    <p class="h-card">Hi there! My name is Zandile Gebuza and I am 20 years old. I am a 3rd year Digital Arts student at Wits University majoring 
     in Animation and Interactive Media. I am also a member of the Wits Golden Key Society. I speak three languages: English, IsiZulu and Sesotho 
     but I am also interested in learning Spanish. I love the arts. I love drawing, painting and listening to music. In high school I took Visual 
     Arts as one of my subjects and I also got the opportunity to be in a marimba band. I'm not that good at coding but last year I was able to 
     create 8, pretty decent, games for my assignments, three of which were group work. Anyway, I hope you enjoy(ed) going through my website and learning 
     about my design process. Check out my <a href="portfolio1.html">portfolio</a> work on the next page.
