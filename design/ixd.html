            <ul>
            <li>My goal is that I want my website to be innovative, functional, and aesthetically pleasing. Even though it might have familiar features, I want people to find 
                my website unique. I want them to find it easy to use and for every aspect to work the way I planned it to. And the most important thing is, I want them to see 
                it as beautiful and organised in a creative way.</li><br>
            <li>I want people who view my website to look at the way I structure my pages and the colour schemes I use and see it as familiar. But, I also want them to be
                impressed at the little breaks of convention that I will use to make my website creative and unique. I want my users to explore every single page, hyperlink,
                and tab that I use on my website. This is so that they have the full experience and they see all the work that I put into it.
            </li><br>

            <li>My target audience, for now, is our lecturer for this course. I know that she has access to a computer and has experience in web development so she will be
                able to view my website and when some things don't pan out the way I wanted them to, she might be able to figure out what went wrong. Eventually, my target 
                audience will be potential employers in the industry of animation ad web development. This will be my new target audience because when applying for jobs, I 
                will need to submit my CV and portfolio so they would need to see my website. This means that I have to modify my website, check it for errors, and make it 
                ready to submit for applications and interviews.
            </li><br>

            <li>I assume that potential employers won't have a lot of time on their hands so the website has to be easy to navigate, functional, and aesthetically pleasing.
                This is because when the website is easy to navigate, it won't take a lot of time to view it, when it is functional, they won't have any issues or have to
                send me emails requesting a functional website, and when it is aesthetically pleasing they will see that I am creative and I organise things nicely and neatly.
                Potential employers, I also assume, want to see who I am as an individual and how I differ from other applicants so I will make sure that my profile page is 
                very detailed and that my portfolio page is a representation of my best work.

        <td colspan="4">My user flow diagram shows the different interaction points that each webpage has and I also included arrows for where the user might flow to after reading the information

           users might not want to read all my blogs or essays so they still have an option to use the navigation bar at the top of eavh page to go to the section of their choosing. I 
           am teaching users that each page has a navigation bar and next button so they can go through the website in its entirety or they can go through it however they want.</p>

    <td><a href="https://www.aprilford.com/">April Ford</a><br>
        <br>I really like the April Ford website because it uses a limited colour palette, it has incredible structure, and it is easy to use. It consists of 5 colours; 
            black, white, blue, purple, and grey and each colour has a purpose. Important words are styled in blue, text is written in black, the background is white, the 
            banners are purple and images are grey. This shows users that there each colour is significant in different ways. The website has a balanced layout which is very
            pleasing to the eye and the font they used is readable and legible.</td>

    <td><img src="images/Donuts.png" width="360" height="250" alt="A screenshot of the Donuts website homepage" title="Donuts Website Homepage"></td>
    <td><a href="https://plunderandpoach.webflow.io/">Donuts</a><br>
        <br>I also like the Donuts website because of its use of colour and layout. They used a wide range of pastel and solid colours and they compliment each other very well. 
            The website is structured as one continuous page but with each scroll a new element is introduced. I found this interesting because, in theory this would be overwhelming 
            but I found it oddly satisfying. The layout is mixture of balanced, asymmmetrical, and radial. The font is also readable and legible.</td>

    <td><img src="images/Colour Palette.png" width="490" height="300" alt="An image of my chosen colour palette" title="Chosen Colour Palatte"></td>
    <td>This is my chosen colour palatte. I got this image from the internet and I specifically chose the version with the hex codes on it so that when I start adding styling to my website, 
        it will be easy to get the colours to be exact. I chose these colours because they look good next to each other and after seeing the Donuts website I am confident that I want my website 
        to be pastel as well.</td>

    <td><img src="images/Font.png" width="360" height="400" alt="An image of my chosen font style" title="Chosen Font Syle"></td>
    <td>This is my chosen font style, Futura. I also got this image from the internet and I like that it presents how the font looks when typing different numbers, letters, and symbols. This font 
        is legible and readable as it was part of a list of legible websites when I searched for it.</td>

    <tr><th colspan="4">The ‘look and feel’ I want to evoke and how it relates to my content</th></tr>
    <tr><td colspan="4">I want my website to look bright but not in a glaring way hence I will be using pastel colours. The background, navigation tabs, and next button colours will be consistent on 
                        every page. The important part of the page will be inside a green layou box and the extar information will be inside a grey box. I also want it to feel friendly but also 
                        professional therfore my buttons will be a mixture between straight and rounded edges. This realtes to my content because it is both professional and also playful and creative. 
                        The blog, design page, and essays will be assessed for the course but the profile and portfolio are my way of showing who I am and the projects I have done, which will be 
                        <q>assessed</q> by a potential employer.</td></tr>
