    <h2>User Alignment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="spacing">My goal is that I want my website to be innovative, functional, and aesthetically pleasing. Even though it might have familiar features, I want people to find 
            my website unique. I want them to find it easy to use and for every aspect to work the way I planned it to. And the most important thing is, I want them to see 
            it as beautiful and organised in a creative way.</li>

        <li class="spacing">I want people who view my website to look at the way I structure my pages and the colour schemes I use and see it as familiar. But, I also want them to be
            impressed at the little breaks of convention that I will use to make my website creative and unique. I want my users to explore every single page, hyperlink,
            and tab that I use on my website. This is so that they have the full experience and they see all the work that I put into it.</li>

        <li class="spacing">My target audience, for now, is our lecturer for this course. I know that she has access to a computer and has experience in web development so she will be
            able to view my website and when some things don't pan out the way I wanted them to, she might be able to figure out what went wrong. Eventually, my target 
            audience will be potential employers in the industry of animation ad web development. This will be my new target audience because when applying for jobs, I 
            will need to submit my CV and portfolio so they would need to see my website. This means that I have to modify my website, check it for errors, and make it 
            ready to submit for applications and interviews.</li>

        <li class="spacing">I assume that potential employers won't have a lot of time on their hands so the website has to be easy to navigate, functional, and aesthetically pleasing.
            This is because when the website is easy to navigate, it won't take a lot of time to view it, when it is functional, they won't have any issues or have to
            send me emails requesting a functional website, and when it is aesthetically pleasing they will see that I am creative and I organise things nicely and neatly.
            Potential employers, I also assume, want to see who I am as an individual and how I differ from other applicants so I will make sure that my profile page is 
            very detailed and that my portfolio page is a representation of my best work.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Interface Elements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="list-item2"><strong>Input controls:</strong> I will add a text field with a submit button for users to leave me a message or contact me. This will added at the bottom of 
                    my Profile page.</li>
        <li class="list-item2"><strong>Informational Components:</strong> I will add tooltips for the images that I use to describe the contents of the image.</li>

        <li class="list-item2"><strong>Navigational Components:</strong> I will add navigation tabs and pagination on each page and at the bottom of my Profile and Portfolio page, I will add 
                    icons for my social media pages.</li>  
    </ul>
        
    <h2>Information Structure</h2>
    <img src="../blogs/blog-images/Information Structure.png" alt="A mind map image of my website's information structure" title="Information Structure mind map">
        
    <h2>User Flow - Interaction Points</h2>
    <p>My user flow diagram shows the different interaction points that each webpage has and I also included arrows for where the user might flow to after reading 
       the information on each page. I want to push the user to use the next button as it will take them to the next page of an essay, or blog or an entirely new tab. 
       However I do know that some users might not want to read all my blogs or essays so they still have an option to use the navigation bar at the top of eavh page 
       to go to the section of their choosing. I am teaching users that each page has a navigation bar and next button so they can go through the website in its 
       entirety or they can go through it however they want.</p>

    <h2>Inspirational websites</h2>
    <p>I have discussed other inspirational websites in my blog posts. These have mostly inspired me in terms of the look and feel that I want to invoke in my website.</p>
    
    <h3>April Ford</h3>
    <div class="side-by-side">
    <a href="https://www.aprilford.com/" target="_blank"><img src="design-images/April Ford.png" class="image" alt="A screenshot of the April Ford website's homepage" title="April Ford Website Womepage"></a>
    <p class="info">I really like the April Ford website because it uses a limited colour palette, it has incredible structure, and it is easy to use. It consists of 5 colours; black, white, blue, purple, and grey and each colour has a purpose. 
       Important words are styled in blue, text is written in black, the background is white, the banners are purple and images are grey. This shows users that there each colour is significant in different ways. The website has a 
       balanced layout which is very pleasing to the eye and the font they used is readable and legible.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Donuts</h3>
    <div class="side-by-side">
    <a href="https://plunderandpoach.webflow.io/" target="_blank"><img src="design-images/Donuts.png" class="image" alt="A screenshot of the Donuts website homepage" title="Donuts Website Homepage"></a>
    <p class="info">I also like the Donuts website because of its use of colour and layout. They used a wide range of pastel and solid colours and they compliment each other very well. The website is structured as one continuous page but with 
       each scroll a new element is introduced. I found this interesting because, in theory this would be overwhelming but I found it oddly satisfying. The layout is mixture of balanced, asymmmetrical, and radial. The font is also 
       readable and legible.</p>
