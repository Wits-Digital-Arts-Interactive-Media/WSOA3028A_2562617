<h2>Original Wireframes</h2>

    <h3>Homepage</h3>
    <img src="design-images/Home - Wireframe.png" width="900" height="700" alt="A wireframe image of my website's homepage" title="Homepage Wireframe">
    <img src="design-images/Home - Mobile Wireframe.png" width="350" height="700" alt="A wireframe image of a mobile verson of my website's homepage" title="Homepage Mobile Wireframe">
    <p>The homepage will have the website name at the top middle of the page. Underneath it will be a navigation menu that the user can click on to go to other pages. The rest of the
       page will be a large image that represents the theme of my website. I might animate the image to make it move around the page. Underneath the image, there will be a button to go 
       to the next page.</p>

    <p>If I were to create a mobile version of my website, the homepage would look like the image on the right. As seen in the image, the mobile version has the same structure as the 
       desktop version. The navigation menu and the website name will be at the top of the page. Also, because in the desktop version the image is landscape, I would have to make sure 
       that the full image is visible and not scrollable with the portrait view of a mobile phone.</p>
    
    <h3>Blog</h3>
    <img src="design-images/Blog - Wireframe.png" width="900" height="700" alt="A wireframe image of my website's blog page" title="Blog Page Wireframe">
    <img src="design-images/Blog - Mobile Wireframe.png" width="350" height="700" alt="A wireframe image of a mobile verson of my website's blog page" title="Blog Page Mobile Wireframe">
    <p>The blog page will have the website name at the top left corner and a navigation menu at the top right/middle. On the left side of the page there will be links to other blog posts. 
       The middle of the page will be the blog post that is currently opened (It will be made to look like the pages of a book hence there are two pages and a divider in the middle). On 
       the right, there will be buttons to go back to the previous page or the next page.</p>
   
    <p>A mobile version of the blog page would have most of the same structure as the desktop version. Howvever, instead of the blog appearing as two open pages of a book, it will be one so the 
       user will be able to flip the page by swiping on their screen from right to left. The back/next buttons would also be moved to the bottom of the page to accomodate the blog.</p>

    <h3>Design</h3>
    <img src="design-images/Design - Wireframe.png" width="900" height="700" alt="A wireframe image of my website's design page" title="Design Page Wireframe">
    <img src="design-images/Design - Mobile Wireframe.png" width="350" height="700" alt="A wireframe image of a mobile verson of my website's design page" title="Design Page Mobile Wireframe">
    <p>This is the structure for all the design pages (wireframes, IxD, and the style guide). The design pages will have the website name at the top left corner and a navigation menu at the top 
       right/middle. On the left side of the page there will be images related to the topic written about in the middle of the page. Below it will be buttons to go back to the previous page and 
       the next page.</p>

    <p>A mobile version of the design pages would be structured a bit differently. The images would be placed at the top of the page after the menu then the paragraphs related to it would be
       placed below it. The buttons would stay at the bottom of the page.</p>

    <h3>Essays</h3>
    <img src="design-images/Essays - Wireframe.png" width="900" height="700" alt="A wireframe image of my website's essay page" title="Essay Page Wireframe">
    <img src="design-images/Essays - Mobile Wireframe.png" width="350" height="700" alt="A wireframe image of a mobile verson of my website's essay page" title="Essay Page Mobile Wireframe">
    <p>The essay page will have the website name at the top left corner and a navigation menu at the top right/middle. On the left side of the page will be the title of the essay as well as a 
       summary. The essay will be in the middle of the page then the buttons will be placed next to it on the right.</p> 

    <p>A mobile version of the essay pages will have the title and a summary at the top of the page. Then below it would be the essay and the buttons.</p>

    <h3>Profile</h3>
    <img src="design-images/Profile - Wireframe.png" width="900" height="700" alt="A wireframe image of my website's profile page" title="Profile Page Wireframe">  
    <img src="design-images/Profile - Mobile Wireframe.png" width="350" height="700" alt="A wireframe image of a mobile verson of my website's profile page" title="Profile Page Mobile Wireframe"> 
    <p>The profile page will have the website name at the top left corner and a navigation menu at the top right/middle. On the left there will be a picture of myself and in the middle there will 
       be paragraphs with my information. Below this there will be buttons to go back and to go to the next page.</p>

    <p>Like the design page, a mobile version of the profile page will have an image at the top and information at the bottom. The buttons will remain at the bottom of the page.</p>

    <h3>Portfolio</h3>
    <img src="design-images/Portfolio - Wireframe.png" width="900" height="700" alt="A wireframe image of my website's portfolio page" title="Portfolio Page Wireframe">
    <img src="design-images/Portfolio - Mobile Wireframe.png" width="350" height="700" alt="A wireframe image of a mobile verson of my website's portfolio page" title="Portfolio Page Mobile Wireframe">
    <p>The portfolio page will have the website name at the top left corner and a navigation menu at the top right/middle. The large rectangles represent screenshots of my artworks, digital art, games, 
       and animations. Below them will be "read more" buttons for users to see more information about the art as well as a button to go to the next page. The next page will be another page of works. I 
       want to have one page for traditional art, another one for digital art, and a third one for my games. Because the Portfolio pages are last in the sequence of the website, the last portfolio page 
       will have a button that takes the user back to the Homepage.</p>
    
    <p>A mobile version of the Portfolio page will show one panel at a time. Each one will take up the whole space on the screen so to go to the next panel, the user will click on the next button.</p>

    <h2>Final Wireframes</h2>
    <p>I kept the same structure as the originals, I just made these much neater and I used wireframe-like icons. The boxes with crosses represent images and the circles with arrows represent the next and 
       back buttons. I also included how the website pages will look on a web browser (the URL bar at the top of the page) and the page footer.</p>
