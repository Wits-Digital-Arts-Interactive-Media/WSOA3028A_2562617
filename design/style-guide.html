    <h2>My goal and aesthetic</h2>
    <p>I want my website to look bright but not in a glaring way. I also want it to feel friendly but also professional. That is why I am using pastel colours and my buttons will 
       be a mixture between being circular and having rounded edges. The background colour, navigation tabs, and button colours will also be consistent on every page.</p> 

       <h2>Colour Palettes</h2>
       <div class="side-by-side">
       <img src="design-images/Colour Palette.png" class="colours" alt="An image of the draft colour palette" title="Draft Colour Palatte">
       <p class="info">This is the colour palette that I might use for my website. I got this image from the internet and I chose it because it has hex codes which will be 
          useful for CSS. I chose this palette because the colours look good next to each other and because I just love pastels. Pastel colours make me feel calm and when I see 
          people wearing pastel colours I perceive them as friendly/happy. Therefore, I am hoping that using them in my website will give off the same impression.</p>
       </div>

       <div class="side-by-side">    
       <img src="design-images/Colour Palette 2.jpg" class="colours" alt="An image of my chosen colour palette" title="Chosen Colour Palette">
       <p class="info">This is colour palette that I have used for the final design of my website. I chose these colours because purple is my favourite colour and the others from the 
         palette complement it really well. I also know that pastel purple is a calming colour so it works well for the feeling of calmness that I want to evoke. I have also incoporated 
         some of the colours from the previous colour palette such as the cream colour, the light orange, and the red. This is because I didn't want to only use purples and blues as it might 
         have been too overwhelming.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="responsive2"><img src="design-images/Final Sketches.png" class="overview2" alt="An image of my final sketches" title="Final Sketches"></div>
       <p class="colour-use">Explain the use of colour for the wireframes. What colours do you use where? Primary colours and secondary colours (purple is the primary colour and the blues etc. 
         are the secondary colour.) Buttons why that specific shape</p>   

         <h2 class="centre-text">Text Alignment</h2>
         <div class="responsive3">
         <img src="design-images/Left Text Alignment.png" alt="An image illustrating left text alignment" title="Left Text Alignment">

        </div>
     
         <ol>
           <li>I want my website name to appear at the top left of all my pages besides the homepage. This is just a way to put the title on the left so that the 
               user focuses on the other parts of the page. The headings on my all pages will also be alighned to the left.</li>
           <li>My homepage's website name will be aligned at the center of the page. Because this alignment is not recommended for longer text, I want to use it for the title of my website as well 
              as the nav menu. Also, I have seen some websites that use centre alignment for the homepage that I found visually appealing, so I'm hoping it will be the same for mine.</li>
           <li>All the content in my webpages will have justified alignment. This is because it makes the work look neat and easy to read.</li>
           <li>My navigation menu will be right-aligned for all my pages besides the homepage. This is so that it doesn't collide with the website name and it 
              also makes the page look visually appealing.</li>
        </ol>

    <h2 class="centre-text">Font Styles</h2>

    <section class="side-by-side">
      <div class="responsive4"><img src="design-images/Font1.png" class="font-image2" alt="An image of my chosen font style for the website name" title="2nd Chosen Font Syle"></div>
      <p class="info"><br>Write about where this font is used and why. Why did I choose it. Different Heading text and Body text</p>

    <img src="design-images/Google Search.png" class="google-image" alt="A screenshot of a Google search" title="Screenshot of Google Search">
   </section>

   <p>This is my chosen font style, Futura. I got this image from the internet and I like that it shows how the font looks when typing different numbers, letters, and symbols. I chose this 
      font because according to Google, as seen in the image on the right, Futura is in the top 10 of fonts that are legible and readable. Below I have included screenshots of some websites 
      that use this font.</p>

   <h2>Inspirational websites</h2>
   <p>These are some artists that I found inspirational to me as an aspiring animator. Their portfolio websites are nothing short of amazing and they used creative ways to display their work, which is what I hope to achieve with mine. They mostly 
      inspired me in terms of the look and feel that I want to invoke in my website.</p>
   
   <h3>April Ford</h3>
   <div class="side-by-side">
   <div class="responsive"><a href="https://www.aprilford.com/" target="_blank"><img src="design-images/April Ford.png" class="image" alt="A screenshot of the April Ford website's homepage" title="April Ford Website Womepage"></a></div>
   <p class="info">I really like the April Ford website because it uses a limited colour palette, it has incredible structure, and it is easy to use. It consists of 5 colours; black, white, blue, purple, and grey and each colour has a purpose. 
      Important words are styled in blue, text is written in black, the background is white, the banners are purple and images are grey. This shows users that there each colour is significant in different ways. The website has a balanced layout 
      which is very pleasing to the eye and the font they used is readable and legible.</p>
   </div>

   <h3>Donuts</h3>
   <div class="side-by-side">
   <div class="responsive"><a href="https://plunderandpoach.webflow.io/" target="_blank"><img src="design-images/Donuts.png" class="image" alt="A screenshot of the Donuts website homepage" title="Donuts Website Homepage"></a></div>
   <p class="info">I also like the Donuts website because of its use of colour and layout. They used a wide range of pastel and solid colours and they compliment each other very well. The website is structured as one continuous page but with 
      each scroll a new element is introduced. I found this interesting because, in theory this would be overwhelming but I found it visually satisfying. The layout is mixture of balanced, asymmmetrical, and radial. The font is also 
      readable and legible.</p>
   </div>

<h3 class="artist">Yulia Ruditskaya</h3>
<div class="side-by-side">
<a class="h-card" href="https://www.yuliaruditskaya.com/" target="_blank"><img src="design-images/YuliaRuditskaya.png" class="image" alt="A screenshot of Yulia Ruditskaya's navigation tab from her 
  website" title="Yulia Ruditskaya Website Screenshot"></a>
<p class="info">I like how Yulia Ruditskaya's navigation tab shows viewers which page they are on by italicising it. This can be seen in the screenshot with the word "Reel" being in italics and the rest of the tabs being in normal 
  text.</p>
</div>            

<h3 class="artist">Natalie Rose Young</h3>
<div class="side-by-side">
<a class="h-card" href="https://www.natalieroseyoung.com/character-design" target="_blank"><img src="design-images/NatalieRoseYoung.png" class="image" class="big-image" alt="A screenshot from Natalie Young's Character 
  Design page from her website" title="Natalie Young Website Screenshot"></a>
<p class="info">I really enjoyed seeing Natalie Rose Young's work because I have watched some of the animated shows that she has drawn characters for. However, I did not find her website interesting. I feel as though it is something 
  that I could make so it lacked in creativity. Which is something I assumed she would excel at given her impeccable character designs and artworks. For instance, the background is white and it could have been better 
  with a bit of colour or some patterns. Another thing is that her drawings do not have descriptions, she just put pictures without any captions about them and their significance.</p>           
</div>

<h3 class="artist">Rafael Varona</h3>
<div class="side-by-side">
<a class="h-card" href="https://www.rafaelvarona.com/" target="_blank"><img src="design-images/RafaelVarona.png" class="image" class="big-image" alt="A screenshot from Rafael Varona's website homepage" title="Rafael 
  Varona Website Screenshot"></a>
<p class="info">I like how responsive Rafael Varona's website is. When a viewer hovers over an artwork, it gets greyed out and a link appears to show that they can read more about it. This is something that I will definitely use for 
  my website to make it interesting.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="artist">Alison Donato</h3>
<div class="side-by-side">
<a class="h-card" href="https://alisondonato.format.com/" target="_blank"><img src="design-images/AlisonDonato.png" class="image" class="big-image" alt="A screenshot from Alison Donato's website homepage" title="
  Alison Donato Website Screenshot"></a>
<p class="info">Unlike all the other websites I have seen, Alison Donato's has a left-side panel as a navigation bar. Instead of scrolling up to change the page, the viewer has all they need from this panel and it might make their 
  experience of the website better. I found this very interesting because it kind of broke the convention of what I know websites to be.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="artist">Ana Leovy</h3>
<div class="side-by-side">
<a class="h-card" href="https://www.analeovy.com/" target="_blank"><img src="design-images/AnaLeovy.png" class="image" class="big-image" alt="A screenshot from Ana Leovy's website homepage" title="Ana Leovy Homepage 
  Screenshot"></a>
<p class="info">I like how simple and straight-to-the-point Ana Leovy's homepage is. She didn't fuss about adding an image or pattern for the background but instead chose to use the colour orange and it is simple but appealing to 
  look at. When viewers want to explore other parts of her website they can click on the links in the light grey text.</p>
