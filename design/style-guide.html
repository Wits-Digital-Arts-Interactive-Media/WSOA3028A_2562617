    <h2>My goal and aesthetic</h2>
    <p>I want my website to look bright but not in a glaring way hence I will be using pastel colours. The background, navigation tabs, and next button colours will 
       be consistent on every page. I also want it to feel friendly but also professional therfore my buttons will be a mixture between straight and rounded edges. 
       This realtes to my content because it is both professional and also playful and creative. The blog, design page, and essays will be assessed for the course 
       but the profile and portfolio are my way of showing who I am and the projects I have done, which will be "assessed" by a potential employer.</p> 

    <h2>Colour Palettes</h2>
    <div class="side-by-side">
    <img src="design-images/Colour Palette.png" class="colours" alt="An image of the draft colour palette" title="Draft Colour Palatte">
    <p class="info">This is the first colour palatte that I might use for my website. I got this image from the internet and I chose it because it has hex codes which will be 
       useful when I add styling to my website. I chose this palette because the colours look good next to each other and I just love pastels. Pastel colours make me 
       feel calm and when I see people wearing pastel colours I perceive them as friendly/happy. Therefore, I am hoping that using them in my website will give off 
       the same impression.</p>

    <div class="side-by-side">    
    <img src="design-images/Colour Palette 2.jpg" class="colours" alt="An image of my chosen colour palette" title="Chosen Colour Palette">
    <p class="info">This is colour palette that I want to use for the final design of my website. I also want to incoporate some of the colours from the previous one such as 
       the cream colour, the light orange, and the red. I chose these colours because purple is my favourite colour and the others from the palette complement it really well. Also, I know
       that pastel purple is a calming colour which works well for the feeling I want to evoke.</p>

    <div class="responsive2"><img src="design-images/Final Sketches.png" class="overview2" alt="An image of my final sketches" title="Final Sketches"></div>
    <p class="colour-use">Explain the use of colour for the wireframes. What colours do you use where? Primary colours and secondary colours (purple is the primary colour and the blues etc. 
                          are the secondary colour.) Buttons why that specific shape</p>
  
    <h2>Font Styles</h2>

   </section>

   <p>This is my chosen font style, Futura. I got this image from the internet and I like that it presents how the font looks when typing different numbers, 
      letters, and symbols. I chose this font because according to Google, it is in the top 10  of fonts that are legible and readable. Below I have included screenshots of some websites 
      that use this font.</p>

   </div>

    <ol>
      <li>As seen in the UI overview, I want my website name to appear at the top left of all my pages besides the homepage. This is just a way to put the title on the left so that the 
          user focuses on the other parts of the page. The headings on my all pages will also be alighned to the left.</li>
      <li>My homepage's website name will be aligned at the center of the page. Because this alignment is not recommended for longer text, I want to use it this once for the opening 
          page of my website. Also, I have seen a lot of websites that use centre alignment in this way that I found visually appealing, so I'm hoping it will be the same for mine.</li>
      <li>All the content in my webpages will have justified alignment. This is because it makes the work look neat and easy to read.</li>
      <li>Finally, as seen in the UI overview, my navigation menu will appear at the top right of all my pages besides the homepage. This is so that it doesn't collide with the website 
          name and it also makes the page look visually appealing.</li>
