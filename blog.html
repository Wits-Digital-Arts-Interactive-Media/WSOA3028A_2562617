        <h3>My goals for this course:</h3>
        <font size="4">
        <ul><li>My first goal for this course is to understand, and learn how to code in CSS and Javascript. I learnt HTML in CAT class when I was in high school so I still remember the basics.
        However, I still plan on putting in the same amount of effort when learning/re-learning all of them.</li>
        <br><li>My second goal is to create a functional, aesthetically pleasing website that reflects my abilities and the effort that I put into my work.</li>
            <li>My last goal is to achieve a mark that is 60% and above. This is the standard that I put for all my courses and it is how I know that I have done well.</li></ul>

        <h3>My experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages:</h3>
         
        <font size="4">
        I found it pretty simple to set up my repository and publish my document to Pages. This is because I am used to working with GitHub from the assignments we had last year. 
        <br>Also, before class, I watched an intro video from Visual Studio Code's YouTube channel, therefore, I was familiar with the interface and knew how to navigate around it.

        <h3>Reflection on the readings:</h3>
        <font size="4">
        I chose two readings: "What Hypertext Is" by Noah Wardrip-Fruin and "As We May Think At 65" by Simon Harper. I chose these because they had fewer pages and I figured<br> 
        it would be much easier for me to engage with two short readings instead of one long one. And I would gain more knowledge from two different sources.<br> 
     
        <br><ul><li>The Wardrip-Fruin reading taught me a lot. This is because I did not know what hypertext is and after reading it I understood it a bit better. The author explores the<br> 
        concept of "hypertext" and shows how different types of academics define it. He eventually concludes that to truly understand the concept one should analyse the<br> 
        definition given by the "thinker who coined [it]" (Wardrip-Fruin, p.126). Theodore Holm Nelson, the creator of "hypertext" defines it as "forms of writing which branch<br>
        or perform on request [and] are best presented on computer screens" (Wardrip-Fruin, p.127). After engaging with this reading I attempted to use what I learnt and<br> 
        give my own definition of hypertext. Hyper- means excessive and text means words/a form of writing so put together, I define hypertext as something that gives you<br> 
        access to lots of words or writing. To relate this to my experience of the internet an example of hypertext would be Wikipedia. This is because when I search for
        <br>something on the site it always leads me to another page or provides links to similar content, to quote my definition, "it gives me access to lots of other words/
        <br>information".</li><br>
          
        <br><li>The Harper reading was really interesting. This is because I did not read the Vannevar Bush essay, that it is based on, but after reading Harper's review about it, I knew<br> 
        exactly what it is about. This reading outlines the impact that 'As We May Think' has made, 65 years later. Harper tells the reader about how Bush created the MEMEX.<br> 
        This is "a device which stores an individual's books, records, and communications. It is also mechanised so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and<br> 
        flexibility" (Harper, p.2). It is also credited as being inspiration for the modern Web. I learnt that Bush wanted computers to help users with whatever they needed and<br> 
        for information to be readily available to them. To relate this to my experience of the internet, this idea of MEMEX basically describes what websites are. I can search<br> 
        for something on the internet and I instantly get referred to websites that match my request which are organised by relevance and popularity.</li></ul>

        <h3>Interesting things about the history of the web:</h3>
         
        <font size="4">
        <ul><li>I learnt that the web was first created as a way for scientists to share experiment data with each other but it grew to become more than that.</li>
            <li>I learnt that Tim Berners-Lee created the first website in 1991 and he also coined the term "World Wide Web".</li>
            <li>Also, I learnt that the internet and the web are not the same thing, and that was shocking to me. "The internet is a huge network of computers all over<br> 
                the world, which are connected together whereas the world wide web is a collection of web pages found on this network of computers" (CBBC Newsround, 2019).</li></ul>
