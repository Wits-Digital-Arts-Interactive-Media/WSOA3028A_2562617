   <h2><u>Week 1</u></h2>
   <h3>My goals for this course:</h3>
    
   <ul><li>My first goal for this course is to understand, and learn how to code in CSS and Javascript. I learnt HTML in CAT class when I was in high school so I still remember the basics.</li>
           However, I still plan on putting in the same amount of effort when learning/re-learning all of them.
   <br><li>My second goal is to create a functional, aesthetically pleasing website that reflects my abilities and the effort that I put into my work.</li>
       <li>My last goal is to achieve a mark that is 60% and above. This is the standard that I put for all my courses and it is how I know that I have done well.</li></ul>
     
   <h3>My experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages:</h3>
    
   I found it pretty simple to set up my repository and publish my document to Pages. This is because I am used to working with GitHub from the assignments we had last year. 
   <br>Also, before class, I watched an intro video from Visual Studio Code's YouTube channel, therefore, I was familiar with the interface and knew how to navigate around it.
    
   <h3>Reflection on the readings:</h3>
    
   I chose two readings: "What Hypertext Is" by Noah Wardrip-Fruin and "As We May Think At 65" by Simon Harper. I chose these because they had fewer pages and I figured it would be much 
   <br>easier for me to engage with two short readings instead of one long one. And I would gain more knowledge from two different sources.<br> 

   <br><ul><li>The Wardrip-Fruin reading taught me a lot. This is because I did not know what hypertext is and after reading it I understood it a bit better. The author explores the concept of 
   <br>"hypertext" and shows how different types of academics define it. He eventually concludes that to truly understand the concept one should analyse the definition given by the "thinker
   <br>who coined [it]" (Wardrip-Fruin, p.126). Theodore Holm Nelson, the creator of "hypertext" defines it as "forms of writing which branch or perform on request [and] are best presented 
   <br>on computer screens" (Wardrip-Fruin, p.127). After engaging with this reading I attempted to use what I learnt and give my own definition of hypertext. Hyper- means excessive and text
   <br> means words/a form of writing so put together, I define hypertext as something that gives you access to lots of words or writing. To relate this to my experience of the internet an 
   <br>example of hypertext would be Wikipedia. This is because when I search for something on the site it always leads me to another page or provides links to similar content, to quote my 
   <br>definition, "it gives me access to lots of other words/information".</li><br>
     
   <br><li>The Harper reading was really interesting. This is because I did not read the Vannevar Bush essay, that it is based on, but after reading Harper's review about it, I knew exactly what
   <br> it is about. This reading outlines the impact that 'As We May Think' has made, 65 years later. Harper tells the reader about how Bush created the MEMEX. This is "a device which stores 
   <br>an individual's books, records, and communications. It is also mechanised so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility" (Harper, p.2). It is also credited as being 
   <br>inspiration for the modern Web. I learnt that Bush wanted computers to help users with whatever they needed and for information to be readily available to them. To relate this to my 
   <br>experience of the internet, this idea of MEMEX basically describes what websites are. I can search for something on the internet and I instantly get referred to websites that match my 
   <br>request which are organised by relevance and popularity.</li></ul>
     
   <h3>Interesting things about the history of the web:</h3>
    
   <ul><li>I learnt that the web was first created as a way for scientists to share experiment data with each other but it grew to become more than that.</li>
       <li>I learnt that Tim Berners-Lee created the first website in 1991 and he also coined the term "World Wide Web".</li>
       <li>Also, I learnt that the internet and the web are not the same thing, and that was shocking to me. "The internet is a huge network of computers 
       <br>all over the world, which are connected together whereas the world wide web is a collection of web pages found on this network of computers" (CBBC Newsround, 2019)</li></ul>
