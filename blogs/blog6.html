    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>I chose to engage with the topic "Internet and the Just Society." I read all three blog posts from the Institute for Internet & Just Society and in the
       paragraphs below, I discuss what I learnt from them. 
    </p>

    <p><cite>Digital Divide Widens</cite> by Maria Tataki & Dimitris Glynos</p>
    <p>The first blog post is about the digital divide getting worse during the Covid-19 pandemic. Tataki and Glynos wrote about how the pandemic forced 
       people to transition to working and learning online, however, not everyone was awarded this opportunity. This is because <q>e-learning and teleworking 
       [had] only been accessible to a privileged section of society</q>. The most vulnerable people were left behind while the rest of the world embraced the 
       new normal. This was mostly evident in 3rd world countries and in low-income families and ethnic minorities in the US. Countries all over the world had 
       tried to mitigate the situation by providing resources such as phones, laptops and data to students in schools but, as the authors note, this was a 
       <q>short-term solution that will not put an end to the digital divide</q>. They further stated, <q>We must make sure that we sustain our efforts to provide 
       access to all beyond our pandemic response</q>. This means that, they want people to have access to technological resources even after the pandemic ends. 
       This is what they believe will lessen the digital divide, everyone having access to the internet and digital devices (Tataki and Glynos, 2020).
    </p>

    <p><cite>Internet Access is a Fundamental Right. Especially, Amidst a Pandemic</cite> by Spyros Kasapis</p>
    <p>The second blog post is about internet access being a human right. Kasapis describes the digital divide as social inequality and says, <q>In order to 
       close it, internet access should be guaranteed to all</q> (Kasapis, 2020). He also mentions that because the pandemic brought an economic crisis, the 
       internet should be free. This is because people could not go to school, they could not go to work, some lost their jobs and many others risked their 
       lives going into the world to make a living. Kasapis used these arguments to support the idea that like food, water, and shelter, internet access should 
       be a human right. He also poses two questions which I will answer:

    <ol> 
        <li><strong>Should all citizens have access to the internet and if so, are governments supposed to take care of it?</strong></li>
        <p>Yes, all citizens should have access to the internet. A majority of citizens in a country are taxpayers and their money gets spent on 
            buildings, roads, schools, public health care etc. So if these people are not able to go to work physically, internet access should be free so 
            that they can work and contribute to society. The same goes for the non-taxpayers, free internet will make a difference in the number of 
            things they have to spend their money on. Also, a lot of countries are run by capitalism and corrupt governments so in a way, giving their 
            citizens free internet is the least they could do.</p>
       
        <li><strong>What should be the rules governing the internet and who will set them?</strong></li>
        <p>The rules for governing the internet should be that the internet must be used for educational, work, and entertainment purposes only. People 
            can not use it for illegal activity and there should be some type of firewall/detector to detect this. This would be governed by a section of 
            that country's government that works with technology, for example, South Africa's Department of Science and Innovation.</p>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p><cite>The Need for Global Internet Connectivity</cite> by Claire Daniolou</p>
    <p>The third blog post is about the need for internet connectivity (broadband). Like the first blog, Daniolou first discusses the digital divide and defines 
       it as <q>the gap of communication created between the part of the world that uses the internet and the part that does not</q>. She continues by stating 
       that it is essential to have access to and have the ability to use online resources. People become marginalised not only by not having access but also due 
       to <q>technological illiteracy</q>. Daniolou further states that, <q>Numerous studies have shown that internet access has a positive effect on the economy, 
       the businesses, the education, the health, and the overall well-being of rural areas</q>. When people have access to the internet, they can get things done 
       faster and they can communicate with people from different parts of the world at no cost. Also, for students, having internet as a resource for education 
       can impact their <q>social inclusion and human development</q>. Daniolou ends by noting that even though it is a great tool, <q>without critical thinking, 
       parts of the digital population can be manipulated</q>. This is because online information is misleading and it can cause violence, hate, terrorism and 
       spread propaganda. Therefore people should use it wisely. (Daniolou, 2020)
