</p>

    <p>Our topic for this week's lecture is <q>The World in the World Wide Web</q>. This is about how the web has had a effect on how the world functions. We had to complete two 
        readings and below are my thoughts on them as well as a reflection of how I relate to the topic.</p>

    <p><cite>Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information</cite> by Graham et al.</p>
    <p class="spacing">
    The Graham et al. reading taught me that information isn't just floating around but is tied to places, both physically and digitally. This connection between information and 
    location is important because it affects how we learn about the world. If some places aren't represented properly, they become invisible to many people. This is because the way 
    we show information about these places isn't just about where they are but it influences how we see and understand them. The reading also states that in spite of the internet 
    reaching many people, there's still a gap between who gets to participate in global conversations and who doesn't. This leads us to argue about whose version of a place's 
    story is told, the people from that area or people from other places? The reading ends by exploring the uneven numbers of people in the world who have access to information. 
    Countries in the Global North have the highest numbers whereas the Global South is very far behind (Graham et al., 2015).
    </p>

    <p><cite>How Geography Shapes-and is Shaped by-the Internet</cite> by Greenstein et al.</p>
    <p class="spacing">
    This reading is about how the internet affects different places. It talks about how people use the internet and how it changes things like 
    business, trade, and how people buy things. The internet helps by making it cheaper and easier for people to communicate, move things around, and find what they need. But not all 
    places benefit the same because it depends on what people like, what other options they have, and what extra things they can do on the internet (Greenstein et al., 2018).
    </p>

    <h3>The relationship between the two readings</h3>
    <p class="spacing">
    The readings by Graham et al. and Greenstein et al. both shed light on how the internet impacts different places, but they approach the topic from different angles. Graham et al. 
    explore how the internet shapes how we perceive different places as well as the world's uneven access to information. On the other hand, the Greenstein et al. reading examines the 
    internet's impact on business and commerce, and explores the inequalities and benefits across different regions. Basically, the two readings relate by showing that information is 
    mobile. It doesn't remain in one place, it travels from one person/place to another and always has an impact wherever it lands.
    </p>

    <h3>How the readings impact my thinking about web dev as a South African</h3>
    <p class="spacing">
    I will use an interesting quote from this week's lecture to frame my answer. This quote is an interpretation of something that is mentioned in the Graham et al. reading. <q>If we 
    don't shape the narratives that are told about us, we become invisible or we are discounted</q> (Geyser, H, 2020). This means, that we will never be taken seriously or listened to 
    if we continue letting other countries tell the world, and us, about our country. These readings, especially Graham et al. impact my thinking by showing me the importance of 
    creating online content that will be recognised as knowledge production. In today's lecture someone mentioned that the data present in the Graham et al. reading is biased because 
    <q>they put a value judgement of what constitutes as valid knowledge</q>. They didn't put into consideration forms of knowledge that are presented in other languages like praise 
    poetry in South Africa or hieroglyphics in Egypt, they just considered GitHub users, Wikipedia contributions, and domain names. Therefore as a South African doing web development 
    I want to create websites that inform the world. I want my websites to tell my story and represent me, which is basically taking control of the narrative of what it means to be a 
    South African.
