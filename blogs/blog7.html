    <h3>What I learned from the readings</h3>
    <p><cite>Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information</cite> by Graham et al.</p>
    <p>
    The Graham et al. reading taught me that information isn't just floating around but is tied to places, both physically and digitally. This connection between information and 
    location is important because it affects how we learn about the world. If some places aren't represented properly, they become invisible to many people because the way we show 
    information about these places isn't just about where they are but it influences how we see and understand them. This leads us to argue about whose version of a place's story is 
    told, the people from that area or people from other places? The reading also explores how access to information, how much people take part in it, and how it's represented are all 
    uneven across different parts of the world. It also states that in spite of the internet reaching many people, there's still a gap between who gets to participate in global 
    conversations and who doesn't (Graham et al., 2015).
    </p>

    <p><cite>How Geography Shapes-and is Shaped by-the Internet</cite> by Greenstein et al.</p>
    <p>
    This reading is about how the internet affects different places. It talks about how people use the internet and how it changes things like 
    business, trade, and how people buy things. The internet helps by making it cheaper and easier for people to communicate, move things around, and find what they need. But not all 
    places benefit the same because it depends on what people like, what other options they have, and what extra things they can do on the internet (Greenstein et al., 2018).
    </p>

    <h3>The relationship between the two readings</h3>
    <p>
    The readings by Graham et al. and Greenstein et al. both shed light on how the internet impacts different places, but they approach the topic from different angles. Graham et al. 
    explore how the internet shapes how we perceive different places as well as access to information whereas Greenstein et al. examine the internet's impact on business and commerce, 
    and explores the inequalities and benefits across different regions. Basically, the two readings relate by showing that information is mobile. It doesn't remain in one place, it 
    travels from one person/place to another and always has an impact wherever it lands.
    </p>

    <h3>How the readings impact my thinking about web dev as a South African</h3>
    <p>
    I will use an interesting quote from this week's lecture video to frame my answer. This quote is an interpretation of something that is mentioned the Graham et al. reading. <q>If we 
    don't shape the narratives that are told about us, we become invisible or we are discounted</q> (Geyser, H, 2020). This means, that we will never be taken seriously or listened to if 
    we continue letting other countries tell the world and us about our country. These readings, especially Graham et al. impact my thinking by showing me the importance of creating 
    online content that will be recognised as knowledge production. In the lecture video a speaker mentioned that the data present in the Graham et al. reading is biased because <q>they 
    put a value judgement of what constitutes as valid knowledge</q>. They didn't put into consideration forms of knowledge that are presented in other languages like praise poetry in 
    South Africa or hieroglyphics in Egypt, they just considered Github users, Wikipedia contributions, and domain names. Therefore as a South African doing web development I want to 
    create websites that inform the world. I want my websites to tell my story and represent me, which is basically taking control of the narrative of what it means to be a South African.
