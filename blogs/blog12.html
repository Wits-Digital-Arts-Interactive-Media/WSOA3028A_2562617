    <h3>Have I met my goals?</h3>
    <p>In <a href="blog1.html" target="_blank">Blog 1</a>, I mentioned that:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>I want to understand, and learn how to code in JavaScript.</li> 
        <li>I want to create a functional, aesthetically pleasing website that reflects my art style and creative abilities.</li> 
        <li>I want to achieve a mark that is 65% and above.</li>
       </ul>

    <p>I am happy to say that I have achieved 2 of the 3 goals that I have set out for myself. My website is functional, people who have seen it find it beautiful, which means that it is 
        aesthetically pleasing, and I think it is a good representation of my art style. I have also managed to get an average of 84%, which is way higher than the 65% that I had set out 
        for myself. However, I'm not yet good at using JavaScript. All the work I have done in the language has been assisted through websites like MDN Web Docs and YouTube tutorials. I  
        also think I'm not yet confident to code in JS without these resources.</p>

    <p>However, I do plan to practising JavaScript over the holidays. I want to get better at using JS the same way I was able to be good at CSS in just a few days. This is so that I am 
        equally good at all three languages as well as not always relying on external resources just to complete JS related tasks.</p>

    <h3>What have I changed?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="spacing">In the first iteration of my website, I added "Next" and "Back" hyperlinks on each page to go back to the previous page and as well as the next page. 
               With JavaScript, I replaced those hyperlinks with buttons and gave them functionality. The code looks for the name of the button and waits for a click event
               so that when the button is clicked, a new window, which is the next/previous page, is opened.</li> 
         
        <li class="spacing">I also added JavaScript DOM manipulation so that after 2.5 seconds, the inner text of the H1 element of my homepage changes to "Welcome to my website!".</li> 
         
        <li class="spacing">The Design, Essays, and Portfolio homepages all have images in them to signify the content that is found in the page i.e. the Essays homepage has two images with 
               the titles of my two essays. For all of these, I added an anchor tag around the image element so that, for example, when I click on one image it opens up the page to that 
               essay. The user will know that they can do this because I also added a pop-up message that informs them about this.</li> 

        <li class="spacing">I also added some animation to these images, using Javascript, so that when I hover over the image, it scales up in size and goes back down when the pointer is away.</li>
    </ul>
         
    <p>These changes are helping me streamline my interaction design through my Informational and Navigational components. I had previously stated that I want my 
        website to be easy to use and to understand and to achieve this, I mentioned that I wanted to add tooltips and pagination. However, as stated 
        above, I have instead chosen to create buttons and pop-ups. In general, buttons are a signifier for interaction because they prompt a user to
        click on them and because mine have arrows pointing to the left and right, the user will know what clicking on them does. Also, with the informational 
        components (pop-ups) the user will know that the images are not decorative but also require a click to open that section displayed in the 
        image. All in all, JavaScript helped me make my website feel more real. Before it felt like it was just words and links on a page but now it 
        feels a bit more structured and website-like which is the feeling that I want my users to get when they are viewing it.</p> 

    <h3>What do I need to be aware of?</h3>
    <p>The things that I should be aware of in the way I develop websites is Language, Representation, Accessibility, Community Engagement and Collaboration.</p> 
       
    <p>I need to be mindful of the language and terminology that I use in my websites because certain words carry colonial connotations or reinforce 
        cultural biases. I also need to make sure that the websites I create represent people who are different from me. I am a young black woman 
        with a lean body type and medium toned skin but I want my websites to not just represent people who look like me but also dark skinned 
        women, plus size women, other people of colour, and queer and trans people. This representation won't just be for the my websites but it's
        also in the people that I work with in the future.</p>
                   
    <p>I also need to make sure that my websites are accessible to people from different backgrounds. This includes those with disabilities or 
        limited access to technology as well as different literacy levels. I could achieve this by making the websites simple, easy to use, and easy 
        to understand. And, I could add language element in my code that changes my website's content to the user's preferred language. This means 
        that they won't be limited to reading in English and for screen reader users, I would have to make use of good semantic markup and ARIA 
        labels etc. so that they are also able to engage with it. Lastly, I would need to involve the communities I am building for in my design 
        process. This is because, like the Disabled Peoples Organizations say, <q>Nothing about us without us</q>. It would be going against the 
        concept of decolonialism to build something without having that lived experience or including the people I am building for.</p>
