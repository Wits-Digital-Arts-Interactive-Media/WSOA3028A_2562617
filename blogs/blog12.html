    <h3>Have I met my goals?</h3>
    <p>What have I done really well from my goals? Since its the beginning of the course, it would be good to set some goals for things that I want to achieve by the end. Below are my goals 
       for this semester: My first goal for this course is to understand, and learn how to code in CSS and JavaScript. I learnt HTML in CAT class when I was in high school so I still remember 
       the basics. However, I still plan on putting in the same amount of effort when learning/re-learning all of them. My second goal is to create a functional, aesthetically pleasing website 
       that reflects my art style, abilities and the effort that I put into my work. My last goal is to achieve a mark that is 65% and above. This is the standard that I put for all my courses 
       and it is how I know that I have done well. Getting a distinction would also be great, but I don't want to put that kind of pressure on myself on just the first website.</p>

    <h3>Where have I struggled?</h3>
    <p>I did not struggle with anything when doing Assignment 1. As mentioned before in my Week 1 blog post, I did HTML and a bit of CSS in CAT class in high school so I am 
        used to the coding and how the tags are used. I just had to apply the theory from the lectures to my website such as semantic markup. Although, I had a bit of trouble 
        trying to refrain from styling my website because that is not required at the moment. I just want to add colour and nice fonts but I know that there is a process to 
        everything and I need to perfect the basics before I go into the visual aspect.</p>

    <h3>What am I proud of?</h3>
    <p>Firstly I am proud that I remembered HTML even though I last practised it in 2021. It's not a difficult "language" but I'm still proud that I can at least code it 
        because I found C# really difficult to understand and use. Secondly, I am proud that my website has met all the requirements from the assignment rubric, all I need to 
        do is edit my blogs, and add more things to my design page now that IxD has been introduced. Lastly, I am proud that I have been able to get my weekly work done on 
        time. I was able to make time to write my blogs, work on my website, and do the lectures all while having other assignments for my other courses.</p>

    <h3>What have I changed?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="spacing">Changes I made. On all my Html pages, I had created "Next" and "Back" hyperlinks to go back to the previous and go to the next page. With JavaScript, I 
               replaced those hyperlinks with buttons and gave them functionality. The JS code looks for the name of the button and waits for a click event
               so that when the button is clicked, a new window which is the next/previous page is opened.</li> 
         
        <li class="spacing">I also added some JavaScript DOM manipulation code to change the inner text of the H1 element of my homepage "Homepage" to the words 
               "Welcome to my website!" when the button on the top of the page is clicked.</li> 
         
        <li class="spacing">The Essays, Design, and Portfolio homepages all have images in them to signify the content that is found in the page i.e. the Essays page 
               has an image with the title of my first essay "UI and UX Analysis". For all of these, I added an anchor tag around the image element so that 
               when I click on the image it opens up that section. So using JavaScript, I added some animation to the images so that when I hover over the 
               image, it scales up in size and goes back down when the pointer is away.</li>
         
        <li class="spacing">To explain these instructions to a user (the fact that they have to click on the image to open the section) I added pop-ups using 
               JavaScript. I first  added buttons on the top of each Html page and they are labelled "Read This First" so that the user can click on it 
               first to see the pop-up message. Another change that I made is creating a menu for all my blog posts using the code that we were showed in 
               class for the main website menu.
    </ul>
         
    <p>These changes are helping me streamline my IxD through my Informational and Navigational components. I had previously stated that I want my 
        website to be easy to use and to understand and to achieve this, I mentioned that I wanted to add tooltips and pagination. However, as stated 
        above, I have instead chosen to create buttons and pop-ups. In general, buttons are a signifier for interaction because they prompt a user to
        click on them and because mine have the labels "Back" and "Next" the user will know what clicking on them does. Also, with the informational 
        components (pop-ups) the user will know that the images are not decorative but also require a click to open that section displayed in the 
        image. All in all, JavaScript helped me make my website feel more real. Before it felt like it was just words and links on a page but now it 
        feels a bit more structured and website-like which is the feeling that I want my users to get when they are viewing it.</p> 

    <h3>What do I want to change going forward?</h3>
    <p>Going forward, I want to work more on my IxD and Design Pages. This is because these are really important for showing viewers how I came up with my ideas for my website.
        I also want to do more research and reflections when I write my blogs. This is because it will show that I did not just rely on the lectures and assigned readings but I
        went above and beyond to make sure that my design decisions are well informed. I also want to re-read readings when I don't understand them or find them difficult to read. 
        This was especially evident in Week 2 when the Moulthrop reading had a large section about McLuhan's laws of media. I really did not understand that reading and I would 
        have a difficult time if I were to explain its contents to someone else. Therefore, re-reading would help mitigate this and give me a better understanding the second time 
        around.</p>

    <h3>What do I need to be aware of?</h3>
    <p>The things that I should be aware of in the way I develop websites is Language, Representation, Accessibility, Community Engagement and Collaboration.</p> 
       
    <p>I need to be mindful of the language and terminology that I use in my websites because certain words carry colonial connotations or reinforce 
        cultural biases. I also need to make sure that the websites I create represent people who are different from me. I am a young black woman 
        with a lean body type and medium toned skin but I want my websites to not just represent people who look like me but also dark skinned 
        women, plus size women, other people of colour, and queer and trans people. This representation won't just be for the final website but it's
        also in the people that I work with.</p>
                   
    <p>I also need to make sure that my websites are accessible to people from different backgrounds. This includes those with disabilities or 
        limited access to technology as well as different literacy levels. I could achieve this by making the websites simple, easy to use, and easy 
        to understand. And, I could add language element in my code that changes my website's content to the user's preferred language. This means 
        that they won't be limited to reading in English and for screen reader users, I would have to make use of good semantic markup and ARIA 
        labels etc. so that they are also able to engage with it. Lastly, I would need to involve the communities I am building for in my design 
        process. This is because, like the Disabled Peoples Organizations say, <q>Nothing about us without us</q>. It would be going against the 
        concept of decolonialism to build something without having that lived experience or including the people I am building for.</p>
