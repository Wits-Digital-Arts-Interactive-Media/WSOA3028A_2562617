    <h3>Have I met my goals?</h3>
    <p>What have I done really well from my goals? Since its the beginning of the course, it would be good to set some goals for things that I want to achieve by the end. Below are my goals 
       for this semester: My first goal for this course is to understand, and learn how to code in CSS and JavaScript. I learnt HTML in CAT class when I was in high school so I still remember 
       the basics. However, I still plan on putting in the same amount of effort when learning/re-learning all of them. My second goal is to create a functional, aesthetically pleasing website 
       that reflects my art style, abilities and the effort that I put into my work. My last goal is to achieve a mark that is 65% and above. This is the standard that I put for all my courses 
       and it is how I know that I have done well. Getting a distinction would also be great, but I don't want to put that kind of pressure on myself on just the first website.</p>

    <h3>Where have I struggled?</h3>
            <p>I did not struggle with anything when doing Assignment 1. As mentioned before in my Week 1 blog post, I did HTML and a bit of CSS in CAT class in high school so I am 
               used to the coding and how the tags are used. I just had to apply the theory from the lectures to my website such as semantic markup. Although, I had a bit of trouble 
               trying to refrain from styling my website because that is not required at the moment. I just want to add colour and nice fonts but I know that there is a process to 
               everything and I need to perfect the basics before I go into the visual aspect.
            </p>

    <h3>What am I proud of?</h3>
            <p>Firstly I am proud that I remembered HTML even though I last practised it in 2021. It's not a difficult "language" but I'm still proud that I can at least code it 
               because I found C# really difficult to understand and use. Secondly, I am proud that my website has met all the requirements from the assignment rubric, all I need to 
               do is edit my blogs, and add more things to my design page now that IxD has been introduced. Lastly, I am proud that I have been able to get my weekly work done on 
               time. I was able to make time to write my blogs, work on my website, and do the lectures all while having other assignments for my other courses.        
            </p>

    <h3>What do I want to change going forward?</h3>
            <p>Going forward, I want to work more on my IxD and Design Pages. This is because these are really important for showing viewers how I came up with my ideas for my website.
               I also want to do more research and reflections when I write my blogs. This is because it will show that I did not just rely on the lectures and assigned readings but I
               went above and beyond to make sure that my design decisions are well informed. I also want to re-read readings when I don't understand them or find them difficult to read. 
               This was especially evident in Week 2 when the Moulthrop reading had a large section about McLuhan's laws of media. I really did not understand that reading and I would 
               have a difficult time if I were to explain its contents to someone else. Therefore, re-reading would help mitigate this and give me a better understanding the second time 
               around.
            </p>
