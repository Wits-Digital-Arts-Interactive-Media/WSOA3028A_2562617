    </p>
       
    <p>This week's assigned readings are about Design Values. Below is a reflection of both the readings and how I think they relate to the course work.</p>

    <p><cite>Values at play: design tradeoffs in socially-oriented game design</cite></p>
    <p>The first reading by Flanagan et. al, talks about designers having to be aware of the ways in which the artefacts they create can <q>embody 
        political, social, and ethical values</q> (Flanagan et al., 2005, p.751). It starts by stating that many designers struggle to balance their 
        own values with those of users and society because there hasn't been much practical guidance on how to actually incorporate those values into 
        the design process. Therefore, they created the RAPUNSEL project and the article outlines its Values At Play as a case study for how others can 
        carry their own design processes. The Values At Play process starts with Value Sensitive Design then goes to Participatory Design, moves on to 
        Reflective Practice, then ends with Critical Technical Practice. This process was explained in detail and the reading provided a lot of 
        definitions but I chose not to include them because they weren't relevant to me. What was relevant was the part where they said, 
        <blockquote>"The excellence of technologies is judged by the value of privacy, community, freedom from bias, universal usability, autonomy, 
        informed consent, and trust" (Flanagan et al., 2005, p.751).</blockquote></p> 
        
    <p>These concepts are important for web development. Websites have to value the privacy of users and they should ask for consent when collecting 
       the user's information. Websites should be developed by a diverse community of people because that makes the websites well-designed, functional, 
       accessible, and ethical. Websites should not be baised or be in favour of some users but not others. In general, websites should have universal 
       usability. They should cater to different kinds of users, people living with disabilities, people who only have mobile devices, people who have 
       limited data etc. If I were a Game Design student, the VAP principles might have been helpful but in terms of web dev, this is what I found to be 
       useful from this reading.</p><br>
        
    <p><cite>A game design methodology to incorporate social activist themes</cite></p>
    <p>The second reading by Flanagan and Nissenbaum is basically a continuation or extension of the ideas discussed in the previous one. Flanagan 
        and Nissenbaum talk about the design practices of Values at Play which is a guide for the process of making games. They also talk about 
        developing tested methods that include activist social themes in game design. And this is done by them exploring the different ways that 
        games can educate and promote activism, focusing on themes from RAPUNSEL, which is catered towards young women (Flanagan and Nissenbaum, 
        2007). Like the first one, I struggled a bit to find a link between this reading and our work in IM. However, this next quote was a bit helpful: 
        <blockquote>"Implementation is the heart of design, wherein the central concern is transforming, or 'translating' ideas, intentions, 
        requirements and concepts into concrete design specifications and to lines of code in a program" (Flanagan and Nissenbaum, 2007, p.185).
       </blockquote></p> 
       
    <p>This quote is referring to design in a general sense so it's easy to connect it to web development. It basically states, for 
        instance, that after planning out my website through the IxD process, wireframes, style-guide etc. I would need to implement that planning 
        into the code that I write. For example, I would use HTML to replicate how I planned layouts with wireframes. And, If I planned for my pages
        to be red, I would style them in CSS to appear as red. Also, If I wanted my images to move across the screen, I would animate them using JS.</p>
