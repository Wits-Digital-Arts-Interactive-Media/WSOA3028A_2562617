    <h2>Changes made from feedback</h2>
    <p>I was told by our tutor that the links that open external websites should not reload the current page that the user is one. 
       This is because the user will have to do "extra" work by having to go back to my website after viewing the one that I linked. 
       I learnt that it is never a good thing to make the user work more than they have to, everything should be easy to use, and that 
       includes the hyperlinks. After learning this, I Googled how this is done and I found that you can simply add 
       <code>target="_blank"</code> inside the anchor tag and when clicked, the link will open on a new tab.</p>

    <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
