    <h3>Changes made from feedback</h3>
    <p>I was told by our tutor that the links that open external websites should not reload the current page that the user is one. This is because 
       the user will have to do "extra" work by having to go back to my website after viewing the one that I linked. I learnt that it is never a 
       good thing to make the user work more than they have to, everything should be easy to use, and that includes the hyperlinks. Another thing is 
       that external links/websites might be broken or taken down and it might be jarring for the user to user a "404 Pgae" while they are viewing 
       my website. Therefore, if the link is opened on a new tab and the page is unavailable, the user can just close it and they can continue 
       viewing the website in the original tab. After learning this, I Googled how this is done and I found that you can simply add 
       <code>target="_blank"</code> inside the anchor tag and when clicked, the link will open on a new tab.</p>
    
    <h3>Reflection on the assigned readings</h3>
    <p><cite>Values at play: design tradeoffs in socially-oriented game design</cite>
        The first reading by Flanagan et. al, talks about designers having to be aware of the ways in which the artefacts they create can "embody 
        political, social, and ethical values" (Flanagan et al., 2005, p.751). It starts by stating that many designers struggle to balance their 
        own values with those of users and society because there hasn't been much practical guidance on how to actually incorporate those values 
        into the design process. Therefore, they created the RAPUNSEL project and the article outline its Values At Play as case study for how 
        others can carry their own design processes. The Value At Play process starts with Value Sensitive Design then goes to Participatory Design, 
        moves on to Reflective Practice, then ends with Critical Technical Practice. This process was explained in detail and the reading provided a 
        lot of definitions but I chose not to include them because they weren't relevant to me.</p>
        
    <p>What was relevant was the part where they said, "The excellence of technologies is judged by the value of privacy, community, freedom from 
        bias, universal usability, autonomy, informed consent, and trust" (Flanagan et al., 2005, p.751). These concepts are important for web 
        development. Websites have to value the privacy of users and they should ask for consent when collecting the user's information. Websites 
        should be developed by a diverse community of people because that makes the websites well-designed, functional, accessible, and ethical. 
        Also, websites should have universal usability. They should cater to different kinds of users, people living with disabilities, people who 
        only have mobile devices, people who have limited data etc. If I were taking Game Design the VAP principles might have been helpful but in 
        terms of web dev, this is what I found to be useful from the reading.</p>
        
    <p><cite>A game design methodology to incorporate social activist themes</cite>
        The second reading by Flanagan and Nissenbaum is basically a continuation or extension of the ideas discussed in the previous one. Flanagan 
        and Nissenbaum talk about the design practices of Values at Play which is a guide for the process of making games. They also talk about 
        developing tested methods that include activist social themes in game design. And this is done by them exploring the different ways that 
        games can educate and promote activism, focusing on themes from RAPUNSEL, which is catered towards young women (Flanagan and Nissenbaum, 
        2007).</p>
       
    <p>Like the first one, I struggled a bit to find a link between this reading and our work in IM. However, this next quote was a bit helpful. 
        "Implementation is the heart of design, wherein the central concern is transforming, or 'translating' ideas, intentions, requirements and 
        concepts into concrete design specifications and to lines of code in a program" (Flanagan and Nissenbaum, 2007, p.185). This quote is 
        referring to design in a general sense so it's easy to connect it to web development. It basically states, for instance, that after planning 
        out my website through the IxD process, wireframes, style-guide etc. I would need to implement that planning into the code that I write. If 
        I planned for my page to be red, I will style it in CSS to appear as red. If I want my images to move across the screen, I will animate them 
        using JS. And, I will use Html to replicate how I planned layouts with wireframes.</p>
