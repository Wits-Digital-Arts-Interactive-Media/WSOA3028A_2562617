    <h3>Changes made from feedback</h3>
    <p>I was told by our tutor that the links that open external websites should not reload the current page that the user is one. This is because 
       the user will have to do "extra" work by having to go back to my website after viewing the one that I linked. I learnt that it is never a 
       good thing to make the user work more than they have to, everything should be easy to use, and that includes the hyperlinks. Another thing is 
       that external links/websites might be broken or taken down and it might be jarring for the user to user a "404 Pgae" while they are viewing 
       my website. Therefore, if the link is opened on a new tab and the page is unavailable, the user can just close it and they can continue 
       viewing the website in the original tab. After learning this, I Googled how this is done and I found that you can simply add 
       <code>target="_blank"</code> inside the anchor tag and when clicked, the link will open on a new tab.</p>
