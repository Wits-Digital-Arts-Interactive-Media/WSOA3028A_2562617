        <h3>Notes on the IxD Process:</h3>

        <h4><u>Goal Alignment</u></h4>
        <p>I want people who view my website to look at the way I structure my pages and the colour schemes I use and see it as familiar. But, I also want them to be impressed at the
           little breaks of convention that I will use to make my website creative and unique. I want my users to explore every single page, hyperlink, and tab that I use on my website.
           This is so that they have the full experience and they see all the work that I put into it. To sum it up, my goal is that I want my website to be innovative, functional, and 
           aesthetically pleasing. Even though it might have familiar features, I want people to find my website unique. I want them to find it easy to use and for every aspect to work 
           the way I planned it to. And the most important thing is, I want them to see it as beautiful and organised in a creative way.<p>

        <h4><u>Interface Elements</u></h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Input controls:</strong> I will add a text field with a submit button for users to leave me a message or contact me. This will added at the bottom of my Profile 
                        page.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Informational Components:</strong> I will add tooltips for the images that I use to describe the contents of the image.</li><br>

            <li><strong>Navigational Components:</strong> I will add navigation tabs and pagination on each page and at the bottom of my Profile and Portfolio page, I will add icons for my social media pages.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reflection on how my original wireframes hold up in line with this process.</h3>
        <p>Now that I have learnt about the IxD Process, I have to redo my wireframes. This is because my original wireframes were very basic and I could have included more labels and
           descriptions. I did not make them too detailed because I did not have that many ideas. So with more experience, ideas, as well as IxD theory, I'll have to rearrange the way 
           I structure my wireframes and prioritise the most important things.
        </p>

        <h3>Reflection on my work for Website 1.</h3>
        <ol>
        <strong><li>Where have I struggled?</li></strong>
                <p>I did not struggle with anything when making Website 1. As mentioned before in my Week 1 blog post, I did HTML and a bit of CSS in CAT class in high school so I am 
                   used to the coding and how the tags are used. I just had to apply the theory from the lectures to my website such as semantic markup. Although, I had a bit of trouble 
                   trying to refrain from styling my website because that is not required at the moment. I just want to add colour and nice fonts but I know that there is a process to 
                   everything and I need to perfect the basics before I go into the visual aspect.
                </p>

        <strong><li>What am I proud of?</li></strong>
                <p>Firstly I am proud that I remembered HTML even though I last practised it in 2021. It's not a difficult <q>language</q> but I'm still proud that I can at least code it 
                   because I found C# really difficult to understand and use. Secondly, I am proud that my website has met all the requirements from the assignment rubric, all I need to do 
                   is edit my blogs, and add more things to my design page now that IxD has been introduced. Lastly, I am proud that I have been able to get my weekly work done on time. 
                   I was able to make time to write my blogs, work on my website, and do the lectures all while having other assignments for my other courses.Â         
                </p>

        <strong><li>What do I want to change going forward?</li></strong>     
                <p>Going forward, I want to work more on my IxD and Design Pages. This is because these are really important for showing viewers how I came up with my ideas for my website.
                   I also want to do more research and reflections when I write my blogs. This is because it will show that I did not just rely on the lectures and assigned readings but I
                   went above and beyond to make sure that my design decisions are well informed. I also want to re-read readings when I don't understand them or find them difficult to read. 
                   This was especially evident in Week 2 when the Moulthrop reading had a large section about McLuhan's laws of media. I really did not understand that reading and I would 
                   have a difficult time if I were to explain its contents to someone else. Therefore, re-reading would help mitigate this and give me a better understanding the second time 
                   around.
