    <h2 class="p-name">Ethical Internet</h2>
    <p>
        by <a class="p-author h-card" href="../portfolio/profile.html" target="_blank">Zandile Gebuza</a> 
        on <time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-05-13">13 May 2024</time>
    </p>

    <p>This week's topic is about how the internet could be a more ethical space. We were assigned Shani Orgad's <cite>The internet as a 
        moral space: the legacy of Roger Silverstone</cite> and below are my thoughts on the reading.</p>

    <h3>What do I understand about the internet as an ethical space?</h3>
    <p>The word internet is short for interconnected network. It is a <q>large system of connected computers around the world that allows people to 
       share information and communicate with each other</q> (Cambridge Dictionary, 2019). The word ethical is used to describe the <q>rational 
       justification for our moral judgments; it [is about] what is morally right or wrong, just or unjust</q> (Government of Canada, 2015). 
       Therefore, I think that the concept of the internet as an ethical space means that it is where people can communicate with each other and 
       share information that is considerate and doesn't negatively affect others. It is a space where people adhere to their own morals and values 
       and respect other people's.</p>

    <p>The Orgad reading states that the internet and the media plays a huge part in people's everyday lives. It also states that <q>the moral 
       significance of the media is the primary framework for people's understanding of the world</q> (Orgad, 2007). This means that whatever is 
       happening on the internet has an effect on people's lived realities. If a user is always exposed to negative content that promotes 
       terrorism, racism, sexism or homophobia, they are likely to adopt those tendencies. It may not happen as a sudden personality change, but
       it can affect how they treat others or the have an effect on their work. Therefore, there is a need for the internet to be more a ethical 
       environment.</p>

    <h3>What would this look like?</h3> 
    <p> In terms of what this would look like, Orgad says it has to <q>[be able] to sustain responsibility and become a truly hospitable space, that 
        is, a space which not only lets others speak, but is underpinned by the requirement that the stranger should be heard</q> (Orgad, 2007, 
        p.36). This just means that people should respect each other and if that is at the core of all online exchanges, it is likely to be more 
        ethical. I think that the internet would be more ethical if it had better Privacy Protection, Security, and Accessibility. Internet users 
        should not have to worry about what their data is going to be used for. Every app and website should give clear information about this so 
        that the user knows what they are getting themselves into. Secondly, users should not have to fear being hacked or being roped into other 
        malicious activities. The internet should have better security measures to prevent users from getting hacked or having their devices 
        corrupted with malware. Finally, the internet can only be ethical if it is accessible to everyone. It doesn't matter if websites are free 
        from discrimination or if there are a thousand articles about inequality, as long as the affected people are unable to be part of these 
        knowledge communities, it is unethical.</p>

    <h3>What are the challenges that we would face?</h3>
    <p>There is a part in the reading where Orgad speaks about <q>the possibilities of establishing the internet as a moral space</q> 
        and these are the things that he notes as important:
       <ol>
       <li>Proper distance and responsibility</li>
       <li>Connectivity, sociability, networking and interactivity</li>
       <li>Reciprocity and exchange</li>
       <li>Anonymity, disembodiment, and online intimacy</li>
       <li>Identity and community</li>
       </ol>
    </p>

    <p>I will speak on the 4th point "Anonymity and disembodiment" in regards to the challenges. Anonymity is the idea that people can anonymous on 
       the internet. This is because they can create a new persona when engaging with others online and unless they use their real names, they might 
       not be recognised by the people they know. This anonymity goes together with disembodiment because it is <q>the idea that once the user is 
       online, the need for the body is no longer required, and the user can participate separately from it</q>(IGI Global, 2024). When it comes to 
       using the internet, a lot of women feel comfortable in engaging in spaces that offer anonymity. This is because the internet is not a safe 
       space for women to express themselevs without being ridiculed and namecalled by men and judged by other women. They would rather have a 
       gender-neutral username or a non-human avatar to disembody themselves to their physicality in order to be safe online. This furthers the 
       notion that only men use the internet or that it's a masculine space. Therefore, even though Orgad points out Anonymity and Disembodiment as
       a way to make the internet a moral space, if people have to change or hide who they are to be welcomed into these spaces, that is not ethical.
