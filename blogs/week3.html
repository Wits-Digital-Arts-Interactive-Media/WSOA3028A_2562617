        <h3>User Alignment:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I want people who view my website to look at the way I structure my pages and the colour schemes I use and see it as familiar. But, I also want them to be
                impressed at the little breaks of convention that I will use to make my website creative and unique. I want my users to explore every single page, hyperlink,
                and tab that I use on my website. This is so that they have the full experience and they see all the work that I put into it.
            </li><br>

            <li>My target audience, for now, is our lecturer for this course. I know that she has access to a computer and has experience in web development so she will be
                able to view my website and when some things don't pan out the way I wanted them to, she might be able to figure out what went wrong. Eventually, my target 
                audience will be potential employers in the industry of animation ad web development. This will be my new target audience because when applying for jobs, I 
                will need to submit my CV and portfolio so they would need to see my website. This means that I have to modify my website, check it for errors, and make it 
                ready to submit for applications and interviews.
            </li><br>

            <li>I assume that potential employers won't have a lot of time on their hands so the website has to be easy to navigate, functional, and aesthetically pleasing.
                This is because when the website is easy to navigate, it won't take a lot of time to view it, when it is functional, they won't have any issues or have to
                send me emails requesting a functional website, and when it is aesthetically pleasing they will see that I am creative and I organise things nicely and neatly.
                Potential employers, I also assume, want to see who I am as an individual and how I differ from other applicants so I will make sure that my profile page is 
                very detailed and that my portfolio page is a representation of my best work.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My site's content, experience, and interface elements:</h3>

        <h3>How does the exercise above relate to my structure, URL scheme, and semantic markup?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This exercise helped me redefine the structure of my website. Instead of just putting things where I think they should be, I started looking at how a user
                might view this. Allocating the content of my website to the important, least important, and interesting categories showed me which pages I should put most of 
                my focus on. For instance, the Homepage, Blog, and Design are the most important because the first is what the user sees first, and the other two are what I 
                will be marked most on according to the rubric. Also, my URL scheme is "https" and that means it is secure from hacking or external alteration.
            </li><br>

            <li>Finally, in terms of semantic markup, this exercise taught me that it is important to use HTML tags for what they were made for. In a previous iteration, I had 
                made my website's title bigger by using the size attribute within a font tag. Through this exercise, I realised that what I have done was incorrect, I should 
                instead use h1 amd once we start with CSS, I will be able to style it the way I want to. This is something that a lot of people do when designing websites and 
                I now know that this is limiting for people using screenreaders as it won't register as a heading but just words. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Reflection on my development progress for the week.</h3>   
        <ul>
            <li>This week I learnt a lot about web development. I always thought it was about code and seeing your work on a website but it is deeper than that. It is about what 
                you want to do, what you want your users to see, and how you make them do what you want them to do because <q>we are in the business of manipulating people</q>
                (Geyser, H). In terms of the actual development of my website, this week I added metadata to each of my HTML files to describe the content of each page. I also 
                added my wireframes from last week to my Design page. The content of my Blog and Design pages is structured inside tables. This is because the table creates a nice
                layout for my page and it doesn't like I'm looking at a bunch of paragraphs on the screen. Apart from this, I also started putting together all my drawings, 
                artworks, and games that will be displayed on my Portfolio page. I know that they are not necessary for now but I just want to have everything in one place so that 
                when I have learnt enough skills I can start populating those pages instead of being told to do so.
