    <h3>Changes made to my website to incorporate JavaScript:</h3>
    <ul>
       <li class="spacing">On all my Html pages, I had created "Next" and "Back" hyperlinks to go back to the previous and go to the next page. With JavaScript, I 
       replaced those hyperlinks with buttons and gave them functionality. The JS code looks for the name of the button and waits for a click event
       so that when the button is clicked, a new window which is the next/previous page is opened.</li> 

       <li class="spacing">I also added some JavaScript DOM manipulation code to change the inner text of the H1 element of my homepage "Homepage" to the words 
       "Welcome to my website!" when the button on the top of the page is clicked.</li> 

       <li class="spacing">The Essays, Design, and Portfolio homepages all have images in them to signify the content that is found in the page i.e. the Essays page 
       has an image with the title of my first essay "UI and UX Analysis". For all of these, I added an anchor tag around the image element so that 
       when I click on the image it opens up that section. So using JavaScript, I added some animation to the images so that when I hover over the 
       image, it scales up in size and goes back down when the pointer is away.</li>

       <li class="spacing">To explain these instructions to a user (the fact that they have to click on the image to open the section) I added pop-ups using 
       JavaScript. I first  added buttons on the top of each Html page and they are labelled "Read This First" so that the user can click on it 
       first to see the pop-up message. Another change that I made is creating a menu for all my blog posts using the code that we were showed in 
       class for the main website menu.
    </ul>
 
    <h3>How these changes helped me streamline my interaction design</h3>
    <p>These changes are helping me streamline my IxD through my Informational and Navigational components. I had previously stated that I want my 
       website to be easy to use and to understand and to achieve this, I mentioned that I wanted to add tooltips and pagination. However, as stated 
       above, I have instead chosen to create buttons and pop-ups. In general, buttons are a signifier for interaction because they prompt a user to
       click on them and because mine have the labels "Back" and "Next" the user will know what clicking on them does. Also, with the informational 
       components (pop-ups) the user will know that the images are not decorative but also require a click to open that section displayed in the 
       image. All in all, JavaScript helped me make my website feel more real. Before it felt like it was just words and links on a page but now it 
       feels a bit more structured and website-like which is the feeling that I want my users to get when they are viewing it.</p>

    <h3>Digital Colonialities</h3>
    <h4>What is Decolonisation?</h4>
    <p>I first read the Mignolo and Walsh reading and watched the lecture video to better understand what decolonialisation is. I don't know much 
       about it and I figured it would be better to go into the section on "Decolonising Technology" with some knowledge of this concept.</p>

    <p>The reading starts by introducing the word vincularidad which is a Spanish word meaning <q>the awareness of the integral relation and 
       interdependence amongst all living organisms with territory or land and the cosmos</q> (Mignolo and Walsh, 2020, p.1). I understand it as 
       something to do with where you situate yourself in the world or how you relate to this idea of decolonisation. The reading then goes on to 
       define how Mignolo and Walsh define decolonisation and they state that their way is not the only way nor is it the right way but it their 
       view of the concept based on their lived experiences. They define decolonisation as <blockquote>"the undoing of Eurocentrism's totalizing 
       claim and frame, including the Eurocentric legacies incarnated in US-centrism and perpetuated in the Western geopolitics of knowledge" 
       (Mignolo and Walsh, 2020, p.2).</blockquote></p>

    <p>So basically it is about re-defining and re-signifying universal fictions created by the global North. Mignolo and Walsh then give an example 
       using the lived experience of slavery, <q>You cannot dismantle the master's house using the master's tools</q>. They said that instead of 
       revolting against their masters, slaves used the tools they were given to create houses for themselves. They were <blockquote>"Transcending 
       rather than dismantling Western ideas through building [their] own houses of thought. And "When enough houses are built, the hegemony of 
       colonial structures will cease to maintain imperial status" (Mignolo and Walsh, 2020).</blockquote> I understand this as you cannot try to 
       practice decolonisation by attacking or putting down what already exists because that is the same method that colonists used when colonising. 
       Instead we should create new ways of thinking and once there are a lot of these, that is how we will see progress in decolonisation.</p>

<h4>Reflection on a chosen reading</h4>

<p>I chose Giorgos Verdi's reading <cite>The Road to Technocolonialism</cite>. I chose it because it was one of the shorter readings, which I 
   usually engage better with, and because it has an interesting title and I wanted to know more about it.</p>

<p>In the reading, Verdi talks about how the popularity and advancement of AI technologies will eventually lead us to technocolonialism. He doesn't 
   explicitly define this concept but I understand it as countries having control over others (colonialism) by using technology or by being in 
   control of it. The reading states that the US and China are dominating in the field of AI and because of this, other countries will be looking 
   to them for AI supply and, in return, they will <q>request for political and economic gains</q>.  The problem with this is that <q>if left 
   unchecked this process can lead to technocolonialism</q> (Verdi, 2020, p.1-2). The US and China will have access to other countries' data, they 
   will be in charge of the technology that these countries have, and they will be able to make decisions that affect those countries' citizens.</p>  

<p>Verdi believes that this is something that is already happening. A lot of countries in the world, especially in the global South want to be like 
   the North. They want to have access to advanced technologies to not be left behind but to also <q>ensure prosperity and security</q> (Verdi, 2020, 
   p.2). Therefore, these countries will give away their citizens' information to the US and China not knowing that they giving themselves away to 
   be technologically colonised. The thought of this is frightening because these countries, especially the US has the power to do anything and get 
   away with it. The US can literally affect the way that we receive information and what kind of information we are receiving.</p>

<p>This is similar to the example that was given in this week's lecture video "Decolonising Technology" about the Canadian residential schools 
   (Geyser, H, 2021). I know a lot about this topic because I learnt about it in high school and I watch a Netflix series that depicted this 
   gruesome history. Basically, the Canadian government indoctrinated Native American/Indigenous children into Christianity and Eurocentric ways in
   hopes of "civilising them". However, as I learnt from the lecture video, they were committing "epistemicide" (Geyser, H, 2021). This government
   was stripping these children from their languages and histories, destroying any bit of knowledge that they had about their cultures.</p>

<p>Therefore, having read Verdi's article I am now aware of the concept of technocolonialism. I now know what it means and how it affects us that 
   are living in the global South, especially in Africa. It was really interesting and helped me tie in what I learnt from the lecture video, what I 
   learnt from high school, and what we've been learning about Digital inequalities.</p>
