    </p>

    <p>Our topic for this week's lecture is <q>Decolonising Technology</q>. We had to choose our own reading from the reading list and write about 
       what we learnt. I chose Mignolo and Walsh's <cite>On Decoloniality: Concepts, Analytics, Praxis</cite> and Giorgos Verdi's blog post 
       titled <cite>The Road to Technocolonialism</cite>. Below are my thoughts on both the readings and about the topic as a whole.</p>

       <h3>On Decoloniality: Concepts, Analytics, Praxis</h3>
       <p>The reading starts by introducing the word <i>vincularidad</i> which is a Spanish word meaning <q>the awareness of the integral relation and 
       interdependence amongst all living organisms with territory or land and the cosmos</q> (Mignolo and Walsh, 2020, p.1). I understand it as 
       something to do with where you situate yourself in the world or how you relate to this idea of decolonisation. The reading then goes on to 
       define how Mignolo and Walsh define decolonisation. They state that their way is not the only way nor is it the right way but it's their 
       view of the concept based on their lived experiences. They define decolonisation as <blockquote>"the undoing of Eurocentrism's totalizing 
       claim and frame, including the Eurocentric legacies incarnated in US-centrism and perpetuated in the Western geopolitics of knowledge" 
       (Mignolo and Walsh, 2020, p.2).</blockquote></p>

    <p>Basically, it is about re-defining and re-signifying universal fictions created by the global North. Mignolo and Walsh then give an example 
       using slavery, <q>You cannot dismantle the master's house using the master's tools</q>. They said that instead of revolting against their 
       masters, slaves used the tools they were given to create houses for themselves. They were <q>transcending rather than dismantling Western 
       ideas through building [their] own houses of thought. And "When enough houses are built, the hegemony of colonial structures will cease to 
       maintain imperial status</q> (Mignolo and Walsh, 2020). I understand this as you cannot try to practice decolonisation by attacking or 
       putting down what already exists because that is the same method that colonists used when colonising. Instead we should create new ways of 
       thinking and once there are a lot of these, that is how we will see progress in decolonisation.</p>   

<h3>The Road to Technocolonialism</h3>
<p>In this reading, Giorgos Verdi talks about how the popularity and advancement of AI technologies will eventually lead us to technocolonialism. 
   He doesn't directly define this concept but I understand it as countries having control over others (colonialism) by using technology or by 
   being in control of it. The reading states that the US and China are dominating in the field of AI and because of this, other countries will be 
   looking to them for AI supply and, in return, they will <q>request for political and economic gains</q>. The problem with this is that <q>if left 
   unchecked this process can lead to technocolonialism</q> (Verdi, 2020, p.1-2). The US and China will have access to other countries' data, they 
   will be in charge of the technology that these countries have, and they will be able to make decisions that affect those countries' citizens.</p>  

<p>Verdi believes that this is something that is already happening. A lot of countries in the world, especially in the global South want to be like 
   the North. They want to have access to advanced technologies to not be left behind but to also <q>ensure prosperity and security</q> (Verdi, 2020, 
   p.2). Therefore, these countries will give away their citizens' information to the US and China not knowing that they giving themselves away to 
   be technologically colonised. The thought of this is frightening because these countries, especially the US, has the power to do anything and get 
   away with it. The US can literally affect the way that we receive information and what kind of information we are receiving.</p>

<p>This is similar to the example that was given in class about the Canadian residential schools. I know a lot about this topic because I learnt about 
   it in high school and I watched a Netflix series about it. Basically, the Canadian government indoctrinated Native American/Indigenous children into 
   Christianity and Eurocentric ways in hopes of "civilising them". However, they were performing "epistemicide" (Geyser, H, 2021). This government was 
   stripping these children from their languages and histories, and destroying any bit of knowledge that they had about their cultures. Therefore, having 
   read Verdi's blog post I am now aware of the concept of technocolonialism. I now know what it means and how it affects us that are living in the 
   global South, especially in Africa. It was really interesting and helped me tie in what I learnt from class, what I learnt from high school, and what 
   we've been learning throughout the course about Digital inequalities.</p><br>
