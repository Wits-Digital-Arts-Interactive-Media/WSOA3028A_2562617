   <h3>Website for a product - Vital</h3>
   <div class="responsive"><a href="https://www.vital.co.za/" target="_blank"><img src="blog-images/Vital.png" class="image" width="600" height="300" alt="A screenshot of the Vital website's homepage" title="Vital Homepage"></a></div>
   <p><strong><u>Information</u></strong>: The Vital website is a form of advertisement for Vital vitamins and health supplements. Even though the product is catered for children, teens, and adults, the website's target 
         audience is adults. This is because they are the people who will be purchasing the products for themselves and their family members. But also, in terms of its design, the website has a basic 
         structure and a common colour scheme; a wesbsite catered for younger people would have had brighter colours and a more creative layout. Users can view this company's products on the website, namely, 
         cereals, healthy snacks, sauces, and vitamins and supplements. They are also able to read about the company's journey and values, they can view the ingredients of these products, view where they can 
         shop for these products, and contact them if they have any queries.</p>

   <p><strong><u>Pros and Cons</u></strong>: One of the Vital website's pros is that users can use the search bar to look for anything within the website. Another pro is that they used a font that is readable and legible, 
         headings are displayed in a large font, and important buttons are outlined in red. Also, the layout of each page is appealing and consists of balanced elements. In general, it is visually appealing 
         and it is responsive so it has good UI and UX design. There are no cons that I have identified from this website.</p>

   <h3>Website for news - News24</h3>
   <div class="responsive"><a href="https://www.news24.com/" target="_blank"><img src="blog-images/News24.png" class="image" class="website-images" alt="A screenshot of the News24 website's homepage" title="News24 Homepage"></a></div>
   <p><strong><u>Information</u></strong>: News24 is a South African news website. Users are able to read the latest news in South Africa and all over the world, about life, business, politics, and sports. Users can choose to 
         listen to the news through podcasts and audio files and they can watch live recordings of news reports. Users can also subscribe to News24 to receive a daily newsletter. Like a real newspaper, News24 
         has a "play" tab where subscribers can play Crosswords, Sudoku, Wordflower, and Quizzes. I think the target audience for this website is young adults because they are more likely to get their news 
         online than elders who mostly prefer watching the news on TV or even reading the newspaper.</p>

   <p><strong><u>Pros and Cons</u></strong>: A pro of News24 is that it has a search bar so users will be able to search for any news story without having to scour the entire website. Another thing is that its navigation bar 
         is detailed, when you hover over one tab, a drop-down list appears of all the pages within the website that are related to that topic. Therefore I would say that it has a relatively good user experience. 
         However, the website does not have good UI design. This is because the user is met with a lot of information and images immediately after opening the website. This is bad because it causes information 
         overload and can hinder their experience of the website due to it being overwhelming.</p>
 
   <h3>Website for property - Property24</h3>
   <div class="responsive"><a href="https://www.property24.com/" target="_blank"><img src="blog-images/Property24.png" class="image" width="600" height="300" alt="A screenshot of the Property24 website's homepage" title="Property24 Homepage"></a></div>
   <p><strong><u>Information</u></strong>: Property24 is a website created to advertise property. Users can buy, rent or sell property to and from other users. On the website, users are able to search for a location and see what properties 
         are available in that area. They are also able to filter their searches based on the type of property, its price, the number of rooms etc. The website has a tab in the navigation bar called "Advice" and it contains 
         articles to help users with their research process to find the best property. It also has a tab called "Calculators" to help users calculate their bond repayments, affordability, and bond and transfer costs. The 
         target audience is adults who are employed or financially stable.  This is because the process of buying, renting or selling property is inherently financial and probably requires bank statements and pay slips etc.</p>
    
   <p><strong><u>Pros and Cons</u></strong>: The pros of Property24 is that it is well-structured and it is easy to read and use. The UI was designed really well and that led to me having a good UX when traversing through it. I have not seen any 
         cons about this website.</p>

   <h3>Website for shopping - Takealot</h3>
   <div class="responsive"><a href="https://www.takealot.com/" target="_blank"><img src="blog-images/Takealot.png" class="image" width="600" height="300" alt="A screenshot of the Takealot website's homepage" title="Takealot Homepage"></a></div>
   <p><strong><u>Information</u></strong>: Takealot is a website that allows users to shop for products, appliances, devices, clothing etc. then those things get delivered to them after 2 days or 2 weeks. The website allows users to 
         search for whatever they are looking for and they are also able to filter their searches based on the category or the brand the product falls under. Users are also able to apply to sell their products on the 
         website.  I would say that this website is targeted at teenagers and adults. This is because they are most likely to purchase things online.</p>
    
   <p><strong><u>Pros and Cons</u></strong>: A pro of Takealot is that when a user clicks on an image of a product, it takes them to another page with that product and information related to it. This page is balanced, readable and easy 
         to understand. However, the homepage is very busy. It has a lot of ads and images and words that it might get confusing for the user. Therefore Takealot doesn't have that good of a UI design because it is not 
         consistent across other pages.</p>

   <h3>Website for banking - Nedbank</h3>
   <div class="responsive"><a href="https://personal.nedbank.co.za/home.html" target="_blank"><img src="blog-images/Nedbank.png" class="image" class="website-images" alt="A screenshot of the Nedbank website's homepage" title="Nedbank Homepage"></a></div>
   <p><strong><u>Information</u></strong>: The Nedbank website is an online platform for the bank's users to be able to perform their bank-related tasks. Users can log into their accounts, read about everything related to Nedbank, and contact 
         the bank when they have any queries. Users are also able to open loans or investment accounts by logging in with their details and following the prompts displayed to them. This website is targeted to adults. This is 
         because they have bank accounts but also because the website contains articles about loans and investments which are terms that are better understood by adults.</p>
    
   <p><strong><u>Pros and Cons</u></strong>: The Nedbank website is well-designed. It has a good UI because important information is written in bold and buttons have a different colour from the background which makes them pop out. The page's 
         elements are put in a balanced and sometimes radial layout which makes them very appealing. It is also very clear that certain words are hyperlinks to other pages/sources because they are written in green text whereas 
         the rest of the text is black.</p>
