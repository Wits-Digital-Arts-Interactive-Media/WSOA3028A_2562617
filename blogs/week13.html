    <h3>Notes from the "Ethical Internet" lecture video</h3>
    <p></p>

    <h3>The internet as an ethical space</h3>
    <h4>What does that mean to me?</h4>
    <p>The word internet is short for interconnected network. It is a <q>large system of connected computers around the world that allows people to 
       share information and communicate with each other</q> (Cambridge Dictionary, 2019). The word ethical is used to describe the <q>rational 
       justification for our moral judgments; it [is about] what is morally right or wrong, just or unjust</q> (Government of Canada, 2015). 
       Therefore, I think that the concept of the internet as an ethical space means that it is where people can communicate with each other and 
       share information that is considerate and doesn't negatively affect others. It is a space where people adhere to their own morals and values 
       and respect other people's.</p>

    <p>The Orgad reading states that the internet and the media has a huge part in people's everyday lives. It also states that "the moral 
       significance of the media is the primary framework for people's understanding of the world" (Orgad, 2007). This means that whatever is 
       happening on the internet has an effect on people's lived realities. If a user is always exposed to negative content that promotes 
       terrorism, racism, sexism etc. they are likely to adopt those tendencies. It may not happen as an out of the blue personality change, but it 
       can affect how they treat others or the have an effect on the work that they do. Therefore, there is a need for the internet to be more 
       ethical.</p>

    <h4>What would this look like?</h4> 
    <p> In terms of what this would look like, Orgad says it has to <q>[be able] to sustain responsibility and become a truly hospitable space, that 
        is, a space which not only lets others speak, but is underpinned by the requirement that the stranger should be heard"</q> (Orgad, 2007, 
        p.36). This just means that people should respect each other and if that is at the core of all online exchanges, it is likely to be more 
        ethical. I think that the internet would be more ethical if it had better Privacy Protection, Security, and Accessibility. Internet users 
        should not have to worry about what their data is going to be used for. Every app and website should give clear information about this so 
        that the user what they are getting themselves into. Secondly, users should not have to fear being hacked or being roped into other 
        malicious activities. The internet should have better security measures to prevent users from getting hacked or having their devices 
        corrupted with malware. Finally, the internet can only be ethical if it is accessible to everyone. It doesn't matter if websites are free 
        from discrimination or if there are a thousand articles about inequality, as long as the affected people are unable to be part of these 
        knowledge communities, it is unethical.</p>

    <h4>What are the challenges that we face?</h4>
    <p>The reading states that <q>The stranger emerges as an individual, but is increasingly vulnerable to exclusion if the voice does not 'fit' or 
       does not match</q> (Orgad, 2007, p.37). This means that even in an internet space that centers compassion and respect, when one person 
       doesn't stick to the status quo, they can be excluded. This is a challenge when creating a more ethical internet because it shows how easy it 
       is for something as small as individuation can make things fall apart.</p>
