    </p>

        <p>From this week's reading list, I chose to read: <cite>What Hypertext Is</cite> by Noah Wardrip-Fruin and <cite>As We May Think At 65</cite> by Simon Harper. I chose both of these readings because 
           they are much shorter than the others and I figured it would be easier for me to engage with two short readings instead of one long one.</p> 
           
        <p>The Wardrip-Fruin reading taught me a lot. Before reading it, I didn't know what "hypertext" is and after reading it, I still don't know what it is ðŸ˜…, but I kind of understand it. In the article, 
           the author explores the concept of hypertext by breaking down some definitions that were provided by different academics. He then mentions that to truly understand the concept, one should analyse 
           the definition given by the <q>thinker who coined [it]</q> (Wardrip-Fruin, p.126). Theodore Holm Nelson, the creator of hypertext, defines it as <q>forms of writing which branch or perform on request 
           [and] are best presented on computer screens</q> (Wardrip-Fruin, p.127). After engaging with this reading, I attempted to use what I learnt to create my own definition. Hyper- means excessive and text 
           is used to decsribe letters/words/forms of writing, so put together, I define hypertext as something that gives a person access to lots of words. To relate this to my experience of the internet an 
           example of hypertext would be Wikipedia. This is because when I search for something on the site, all the articles have links or references to other pages with similar content. Therefore, Wikipedia is 
           hypertext because it gives me access to lots of other information.</p> 
           
        <p>The Harper reading was a bit harder to understand. This is because I haven't read the essay by Vannevar Bush, that it is based on, however, I was still able to learn a few things from it. This reading 
           outlines the impact that <cite>As We May Think</cite> has made, 65 years later. Harper tells the reader about how Bush created the MEMEX. This is <q>a device which stores an individual's books, records, 
           and communications. It is also mechanised so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility</q> (Harper, p.2). The author also mentions that MEMEX is credited as being inspiration for the 
           modern Web. He also states that Bush wanted computers to help users with whatever they needed and for information to be readily available to them. To relate this to my experience of the internet, this 
           idea of MEMEX basically describes what browsers are. I can search for something on the internet and I instantly get referred to websites that match my request which are organised by relevance and 
           popularity.</p>

        <p>After reading the aforementioned articles, I realised that I know a lot about computers, websites, and the internet but I don't really know about how they came to be. Therefore, I did some quick Google 
           searches for some things that came to mind. Below are some of the things I learnt:</p>

        <ul><li>I learnt that the web was first created as a way for scientists to share experiment data with each other but it grew to become more than that.</li>
            <li>I learnt that Tim Berners-Lee created the first website in 1991 and he also coined the term "World Wide Web".</li>
            <li>Also, I learnt that the internet and the web are not the same thing. This was shocking to me. I always thought that they are the same or that they are interchangable words to describe the same term 
                but it turns out that they are not. The next quote helped me better understand the difference between the two.<q> The internet is a huge network of computers all over the world, which are connected 
                together whereas the world wide web is a collection of web pages found on this network of computers</q> (CBBC Newsround, 2019).</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Dev-Log</h2>
        <p>This week we had to set up our GitHub pages and start planning for the design of our websites. I found it pretty simple to set up my repository and publish my document to Pages. This is because I am used 
           to working with GitHub from the assignments we had last year. Visual Studio Code was the only thing that I was unfamiliar with. This is because I was used to just using Visual Studio and Notepad++ for my 
           coding. However, I was able to watch an "Intro To" video from Visual Studio Code's YouTube channel, to get used to the interface and to know how to navigate around it. I now know how to use it and I'm also
           able to add extensions and use the Live Server.</p> 
           
        <p>Since its the beginning of the course, it would be good to set some goals for things that I want to achieve by the end. Below are my goals for this semester:</p>
           <ul>
            <li>My first goal for this course is to understand, and learn how to code in JavaScript. I learnt HTML in CAT class when I was in high school so I still remember how to use it. CSS is also pretty simple 
                because I watched some YouTube Vdeos and I didn't find them hard to follow. So it would be great if I can get as good in JS as I am in HTML and CSS.</li> 
            <li>My second goal is to create a functional, aesthetically pleasing website that reflects my art style, abilities and the effort that I put into my work.</li>
            <li>My last goal is to achieve a mark that is 65% and above. This is the standard that I put for all my courses and it is how I know that I have done well. Getting a distinction would also be great, but 
                I don't want to put that kind of pressure on myself on just the first website.</li>
        </ul>
