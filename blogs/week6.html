   <h3>Planning for the UI & UX Analysis Essay</h3>

   <p><strong>Website for a product - <a href="https://www.vital.co.za/">Vital</a></strong></p><br>

        <h4>Information:</h4>
        <p>The Vital website is a form of advertisement for Vital vitamins and health supplements. Even though the product is catered for children, teens, 
           and adults, the website's target audience is adults. This is because they are the people who will be purchasing the products for themselves and 
           their family members. Users can view this company's products on the website, namely, cereals, healthy snacks, sauces, and vitamins and supplements. 
           They are also able to read about the company's journey and values, they can view the ingredients of these products, view where they can shop for 
           these products, and contact them if they have any queries.
        </p>

        <h4>Pros and Cons:</h4>
        <p>One of the Vital website's pros is that users can use the search bar to look for anything within the website. Another pro is that they used a font 
           that is readable and legible, headings are displayed in a large font, and important buttons are outlined in red. Also, the layout of each page is 
           appealing and consists of balanced elements. In general, it is visually appealing and it is responsive so it has good UI and UX design. There are 
           no cons that I have identified from this website.

   <p><strong>Website for news - <a href="https://www.news24.com/">News24</a></strong></p><br>
   <img src="blog-images/News24.png" width="650" height="350" alt="A screenshot of the News24 website's homepage" title="News24 Homepage">
        <h4>Information:</h4>
        <p>News24 is a South African news website. Users are able to read the latest news in South Africa and all over the world, about life, business, 
           politics, and sports. Users can choose to listen to the news through podcasts and audio files and they can watch live recordings of news reports. 
           Users can also subscribe to News24 to receive a daily newsletter. Like a real newspaper, News24 has a "play" tab where subscribers can play 
           Crosswords, Sudoku, Wordflower, and Quizzes. I think the target audience for this website is young adults because they are more likely to get their 
           news online than elders who mostly prefer watching the news on TV or even reading the newspaper.
        </p>

        <h4>Pros and Cons:</h4>
        <p>A pro of News24 is that it has a search bar so users will be able to search for any news story without having to scour the entire website. Another 
           thing is that its navigation bar is detailed, when you hover over one tab, a drop-down list appears of all the pages within the website that are 
           related to that topic. Therefore I would say that it has a relatively good user experience. However, the website does not have good UI design. This 
           is because the user is met with a lot of information and images immediately after opening the website. This is bad because it causes information 
           overload and can hinder their experience of the website.

   <p><strong>Website for property - <a href="https://www.property24.com/">Property24</a></strong></p><br>
   <img src="blog-images/Property24.png" width="650" height="350" alt="A screenshot of the Property24 website's homepage" title="Property24 Homepage">
        <h4>Information:</h4>
        <p>Property24 is a website created to advertise property. Users can buy, rent or sell property to and from other users. On the website, users are able
           to search for a location and see what properties are available in that area. They are also able to filter their searches based on the type of property, 
           its price, the number of rooms etc. The website has a tab in the navigation bar called "Advice" and it contains articles to help users with their 
           research process to find the best property. It also has a tab called "Calculators" to help users calculate their bond repayments, affordability, and 
           bond and transfer costs. The target audience is adults who are employed or financially stable.  This is because the process of buying, renting or 
           selling property is inherently financial and probably requires bank statements and pay slips etc.
        </p>
    
        <h4>Pros and Cons:</h4>
        <p>The pros of Property24 is that it is well-structured and it is easy to read and use. The UI was designed really well and that led to me having a good 
           UX when traversing through it. I have not seen any cons about this website.

   <p><strong>Website for shopping - <a href="https://www.takealot.com/">Takealot</a></strong></p><br>
   <img src="blog-images/Takealot.png" width="650" height="350" alt="A screenshot of the Takealot website's homepage" title="Takealot Homepage">
        <h4>Information:</h4>
        <p>Takealot is a website that allows users to shop for products, appliances, devices, clothing etc. then those things get delivered to them after 2 days 
           or 2 weeks. The website allows users to search for whatever they are looking for and they are also able to filter their searches based on the category 
           or the brand the product falls under. Users are also able to apply to sell their products on the website.  I would say that this website is targeted at 
           teenagers and adults. This is because they are most likely to purchase things online.
        </p>
    
        <h4>Pros and Cons:</h4>
        <p>A pro of Takealot is that when a user clicks on an image of a product, it takes them to another page with that product and information related to it. 
           This page is balanced, readable and easy to understand. However, the homepage is very busy. It has a lot of ads and images and words that it might get 
           confusing for the user. Therefore Takealot doesn't have that good of a UI design because it is not consistent across other pages.

   <p><strong>Website for banking - <a href="https://personal.nedbank.co.za/home.html">Nedbank</a></strong></p><br>
   <img src="blog-images/Nedbank.png" width="650" height="350" alt="A screenshot of the Nedbank website's homepage" title="Nedbank Homepage">
        <h4>Information:</h4>
        <p>The Nedbank website is an online platform for the bank's users to be able to perform their bank-related tasks. Users can log into their accounts, read 
           about everything related to Nedbank, and contact the bank when they have any queries. Users are also able to open loans or investment accounts by 
           logging in with their details and following the prompts displayed to them. This website is targeted to adults. This is because they have bank accounts 
           but also because the website contains articles about loans and investments which are terms that are better understood by adults.
        </p>
    
        <h4>Pros and Cons:</h4>
        <p>The Nedbank website is well-designed. It has a good UI because important information is written in bold and buttons have a different colour from the 
           background which makes them pop out. The page's elements are put in a balanced and sometimes radial layout which makes them very appealing. It is also 
           very clear that certain words are hyperlinks to other pages/sources because they are written in green text whereas the rest of the text is black.
