    <h2 class="p-name">Responsive Design</h2>
    <p>
        by <a class="p-author h-card" href="../portfolio/profile.html" target="_blank">Zandile Gebuza</a> 
        on <time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-05-06">06 May 2024</time>
    </p>

    <p>According to WebFX, these are the benefits of responsive design:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cost effectiveness</li>
        <li>Flexibility</li>
        <li>Improved user experience</li>
        <li>Search engine optimization gains</li>
        <li>Ease of management</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These are the challenges of responsive design:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Not every site looks great on every device</li>
    <li>You could run into problems with resized advertisements or banner ads.</li>
    <li>It may be difficult for you to create a responsive website on your own that is unique and accurate to your branding.</li>
    <li>You may want to offer different things to different users according to which device they use, and this can be somewhat difficult on responsive 
        websites.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I believe that because not everyone has a desktop so it's important to design websites so that they can be viewed from mobile devices. 
       Accessibility is not about building for people living with disabilities but it is about making sure that you reach the widest audience 
       possible. Below are some of the things that I have done to make my website responsive and accessible.</p>

       <h3>Different Devices</h3>
       <p>I made my website repsonsive on three different sized devices. The sizes I have targeted is 457 x 815 for smartphones, 757 x 945 for tablets, and 1024 x 620 for small laptops. The default size is 1536 x 864 
        which is my laptop screen size that the website was created from. Below are screenshots from the Developer Tools view of my website. I made screenshots from different sections of the website so that the changes 
        can be differentiated.
       </p>

       <div class="side-by-side">
       <img src="blog-images/Responsive 1.png" class="resize1" alt="A screenshot of my website in the Developer Tools view of 457x815" title="Developer Tools Mobile View">
       <img src="blog-images/Responsive 2.png" class="resize2" alt="A screenshot of my website in the Developer Tools view of 757x945" title="Developer Tools Tablet View">
       </div>
       
       <img src="blog-images/Responsive 3.png" class="resize3" alt="A screenshot of my website in the Developer Tools view of 1024x620" title="Developer Tools Tablet View">

       <ul>
        <li class="move-words">As seen in the first image, I was able to make all of my website's text content responsive for smartphones. The website title moves from the left corner and is now centered. The nav menu also changes from 
            being a horizontal row to a column. The blog tabs are also removed so that the actual blog can take up the entire page's space. This was done to make the page look neater but also to make it functional.
        <li class="move-words">As seen in the second image, my website is responsive for tablets. The structure remains the same as the desktop version but the elements are a bit smaller.</li>
        <li class="move-words">As seen in the third image, my website is responsive for small laptops. My laptop is pretty big and because I designed the website on it, things were placed according to its size. However, other people's 
            laptops might be smaller than mine so it's important the the website is responsive for them. Just like the tablet, the layout remains the same as the desktop version but the elements are smaller and centered.</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Screen Readers</h3>
       <div class="side-by-side">
       <img src="blog-images/Visual ARIA 1.png" class="accessibility" alt="A screenshot showing how a sreen reader engages with my website" title="ARIA Labels">
       <p class="info">I want my website to be accessible to people who use screen readers. This is something that I did not know about before doing this course but now it is something that I want to make a 
        priority, going forward. As seen in the image of the left, my website images have alt tags, titles, descriptions and ARIA labels. This means that even though a screen reader user cannot actually see 
        the images, they will know what the image is called and what elements it contains.</p>
       </div>

       <h3>Colour Blindness</h3>
       <p>Just like the above section, I want my website to be accessible to users with colourblindness. I found an extension in the Chrome Web Store called "Colorblind Emulator" that changes what my website looks 
        like according to different types of colourblindness. There are 4 types and each one is a spectrum but for this purpose, I chose the ones that show the most variation.</p>
       
       <p><strong>Achromatopsia</strong> is colourblindness where a person cannot see any colour at all. </p>
       <div class="side-by-side">
       <img src="blog-images/Achromatopsia - Without colour.png" class="accessibility" alt="A screenshot showing how someone with Achromatopsia sees my website" title="Achromatopsia Version of my Website">
       <p class="info2">As seen in the image on the left, my website is completely greyed out and the only dark parts are the text that is in a black colour. The background colours however, still have some 
        variation. The header section is originally coloured in a dark purple and the middle section is light purple and in the image, the header is a darker grey than the middle section. This means that 
        even though the rest of the page is one tone, a person with Achromatopsia will be able to differentiate the header from the content/middle section of the page.</p>
       </div>
   
       <p><strong>Deuteranopia</strong> is green colourblindness.</p>
       <div class="side-by-side">
       <img src="blog-images/Deuteranopia - Green colourblindness.png" class="accessibility" alt="A screenshot showing how someone with Deuteranopia sees my website" title="Deuteranopia Version of my Website">
       <p class="info2"><br>As seen in the image on the left, my website is a bit grey but the colours are more noticeable. Instead of the bright purple that is seen in full colour, a person with Deuteranopia sees a 
        dull navy blue or greyish purple colour. Also, the nav menu buttons that were pink are now yellow/tan. This means that people with this condition will be able to differentiate the nav menu from the 
        other sections on the page. As well as the images from the greyish background.</p>
       </div>

       <p><strong>Tritanopia</strong> is blue colourblindness.</p>
       <div class="side-by-side">
       <img src="blog-images/Tritanopia - Blue colourblindness.png" class="accessibility" alt="A screenshot showing how someone with Tritanopia sees my website" title="Tritanopia Version of my Website">
       <p class="info2">As seen in the image on the left, my website background is greyed out. This means that people with Tritanopia see purple as grey, which makes sense given that purple is blue+red. However, 
        the nav menu buttons that were originally in a bright pink colour now look a bit dull and are closer to a light red colour. What is surprising, though, is that the blog images/cards were originally in a light 
        blue colour and in this image, they still look the same, just less bright. However, this is great for variation, because it means that the images will stand out from the rest of the page.</p>
       </div> 
   
       <p><strong>Protanopia</strong> is red colourblindness.</p>
       <div class="side-by-side">
       <img src="blog-images/Protanopia - Red colourblindness.png" class="accessibility" alt="A screenshot showing how someone with Protanopia sees my website" title="Protanopia Version of my Website">
       <p class="info2"><br>As seen in the image on the left and the second one above, Protanopia and Deuteranopia are similar. However, people with Protanopia will see the blog images/cards in the same colour as the 
        background than those with Deuteranopia. Also, people with Protanopia will see the header and nav menu buttons as much brighter than the other one.</p>
