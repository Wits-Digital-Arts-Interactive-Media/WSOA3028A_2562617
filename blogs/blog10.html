    <h3>Changes made from feedback</h3>
    <p>I was told by our tutor that the links that open external websites should not reload the current page that the user is one. This is because 
       the user will have to do "extra" work by having to go back to my website after viewing the one that I linked. I learnt that it is never a 
       good thing to make the user work more than they have to, everything should be easy to use, and that includes the hyperlinks. Another thing is 
       that external links/websites might be broken or taken down and it might be jarring for the user to user a "404 Pgae" while they are viewing 
       my website. Therefore, if the link is opened on a new tab and the page is unavailable, the user can just close it and they can continue 
       viewing the website in the original tab. After learning this, I Googled how this is done and I found that you can simply add 
       <code>target="_blank"</code> inside the anchor tag and when clicked, the link will open on a new tab.</p>
    
    <h3>Reflection on the assigned readings</h3>
    <p><cite>Values at play: design tradeoffs in socially-oriented game design</cite></p>
    <p>The first reading by Flanagan et. al, talks about designers having to be aware of the ways in which the artefacts they create can <q>embody 
        political, social, and ethical values</q> (Flanagan et al., 2005, p.751). It starts by stating that many designers struggle to balance their 
        own values with those of users and society because there hasn't been much practical guidance on how to actually incorporate those values 
        into the design process. Therefore, they created the RAPUNSEL project and the article outline its Values At Play as case study for how 
        others can carry their own design processes. The Value At Play process starts with Value Sensitive Design then goes to Participatory Design, 
        moves on to Reflective Practice, then ends with Critical Technical Practice. This process was explained in detail and the reading provided a 
        lot of definitions but I chose not to include them because they weren't relevant to me.</p>
        
    <p>What was relevant was the part where they said, <blockquote>"The excellence of technologies is judged by the value of privacy, community, 
        freedom from bias, universal usability, autonomy, informed consent, and trust" (Flanagan et al., 2005, p.751).</blockquote> These concepts 
        are important for web development. Websites have to value the privacy of users and they should ask for consent when collecting the user's 
        information. Websites should be developed by a diverse community of people because that makes the websites well-designed, functional, 
        accessible, and ethical. Websites should not be baised or be in favour of some users but not others. In general, websites should have 
        universal usability. They should cater to different kinds of users, people living with disabilities, people who only have mobile devices, 
        people who have limited data etc. If I were taking Game Design the VAP principles might have been helpful but in terms of web dev, this is 
        what I found to be useful from the reading.</p>
        
    <p><cite>A game design methodology to incorporate social activist themes</cite></p>
    <p>The second reading by Flanagan and Nissenbaum is basically a continuation or extension of the ideas discussed in the previous one. Flanagan 
        and Nissenbaum talk about the design practices of Values at Play which is a guide for the process of making games. They also talk about 
        developing tested methods that include activist social themes in game design. And this is done by them exploring the different ways that 
        games can educate and promote activism, focusing on themes from RAPUNSEL, which is catered towards young women (Flanagan and Nissenbaum, 
        2007).</p>
       
    <p>Like the first one, I struggled a bit to find a link between this reading and our work in IM. However, this next quote was a bit helpful. 
        <blockquote>"Implementation is the heart of design, wherein the central concern is transforming, or 'translating' ideas, intentions, 
        requirements and concepts into concrete design specifications and to lines of code in a program" (Flanagan and Nissenbaum, 2007, p.185).
       </blockquote> This quote is referring to design in a general sense so it's easy to connect it to web development. It basically states, for 
        instance, that after planning out my website through the IxD process, wireframes, style-guide etc. I would need to implement that planning 
        into the code that I write. If I planned for my page to be red, I will style it in CSS to appear as red. If I want my images to move across 
        the screen, I will animate them using JS. And, I will use Html to replicate how I planned layouts with wireframes.</p>
   
    <h3>The benefits and challenges of responsive design</h3>
    <p>According to WebFX, these are the benefits of responsive design:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cost effectiveness</li>
        <li>Flexibility</li>
        <li>Improved user experience</li>
        <li>Search engine optimization gains</li>
        <li>Ease of management</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These are the challenges of responsive design:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Not every site looks great on every device</li>
    <li>You could run into problems with resized advertisements or banner ads.</li>
    <li>It may be difficult for you to create a responsive website on your own that is unique and accurate to your branding.</li>
    <li>You may want to offer different things to different users according to which device they use, and this can be somewhat difficult on responsive 
        websites.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I believe that because not everyone has a desktop so it's important to design websites so that they can be viewed from mobile devices. 
       Accessibility is not about building for people living with disabilities but it is about making sure that you reach the widest audience 
       possible.</p>
   
    <h3>How our code matters in decolonialism</h3>
    <p>Decolonialism is all about <q>creating new schools of thought</q> therefore the things that I should be aware of in the way I develop 
       websites is Language, Representation, Accessibility, Community Engagement and Collaboration.</p> 
       
    <p>I need to be mindful of the language and terminology that I use in my websites because certain words carry colonial connotations or reinforce 
       cultural biases. I also need to make sure that the websites I create represent people who are different from me. I am a young black woman 
       with a lean body type and medium toned skin but I want my websites to not just represent people who look like me but also dark skinned 
       women, plus size women, other people of colour, and queer and trans people. This representation won't just be for the final website but it's
       also in the people that I work with.</p>
        
    <p>I also need to make sure that my websites are accessible to people from different backgrounds. This includes those with disabilities or 
       limited access to technology as well as different literacy levels. I could achieve this by making the websites simple, easy to use, and easy 
       to understand. And, I could add language element in my code that changes my website's content to the user's preferred language. This means 
       that they won't be limited to reading in English and for screen reader users, I would have to make use of good semantic markup and ARIA 
       labels etc. so that they are also able to engage with it. Lastly, I would need to involve the communities I am building for in my design 
       process. This is because, like the Disabled Peoples Organizations say, <q>Nothing about us without us</q>. It would be going against the 
       concept of decolonialism to build something without having that lived experience or including the people I am building for.</p>
