    <h3>Close reading of <cite>Making a Feminist Internet in Africa</cite> by Sheena Magenya</h3>
    <p>
    Sheena Magenya's article discusses the importance of African feminists and their involvement in shaping the internet to make it more inclusive and representative. She 
    wrote this during the COVID-19 pandemic, where there was an increased reliance on the internet for communication and information. <q>The internet and other communication 
    technologies became a lifeline</q> because they were <q>presented as a solution to a social problem</q> (Magenya, 2020, p.2). However, this solution disregarded the 
    inequality that exists in access to the internet and the fact that the most disadvantaged people during this time were African women and queer African people.
    </p>

    <p>
    <blockquote>"The inequality of access to and representation on the internet is fast replicating existing oppression and suppression. Africa’s particular voice and history 
    in this dynamic needs to be a loud and powerful narrative that shifts the dominant white tide towards a different and more inclusive internet" (p.4).</blockquote> In the 
    article, Magenya talks about gatherings that happened aiming to create a feminist internet, with a focus on the African context. These gatherings brought together 
    activists, thinkers, artists, and feminists to discuss the impact of technology and the internet on their lives and work. They also aimed to challenge the idea that 
    technology automatically solves social problems and emphasize the importance of diverse voices in shaping online spaces. One key point that was raised across all 
    gatherings is the issue of online gender-based violence, which disproportionately affects women, the LGBTQIA+ community, and gender non-conforming people. Magenya even 
    states that the worst part is that even though the use of the internet in Africa is increasing, there is little to no legislation to address this violence in many 
    countries (Magenya, 2020, p.3). That is why she believes that the internet should not replicate existing inequalities and oppressions but should instead be a space for 
    empowerment and inclusion.
    </p>

    <p>
    <blockquote>"...we need more African feminists taking up space, telling stories, giving alternative views, creating body positive content, showing off our bodies and 
    talents and skills. African feminists make more room for African women online" (p.6).</blockquote> Further on in the article, Magenya addresses the perception of Africa 
    as a passive recipient of technology rather than an innovator. <q>When it comes to technology, Africa is often positioned as a beneficiary, not an innovator of it</q> 
    (Magenya, 2020, p.5). She challenges this narrative by highlighting the contributions of African women, LGBTQIA individuals, and people living with disabilities in 
    shaping the internet and using technology to improve their lives. That is why the article emphasizes the need for more African feminists to take up space online. They 
    need to tell their stories, and challenge dominant narratives. It also relates to something I learnt from the The World in WWW/Graham et al. lecture video, <q>If our 
    stories are not told and if we don't shape the narratives about ourselves, we become invisible or are discounted</q> (Geyser, H. 2020). 
    </p>

    <p>
    In conclusion, this reading taught me that it is important for the internet to be feminist and have more African voices. This is essential for promoting diversity, 
    safety, and fun online. It also taught me that it is not only necessary but crucial, especially when global crises like COVID-19 pandemic happen.
