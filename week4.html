        <u>Goal Alignment</u>
        <br><br>
        My goal is that I want my website to be innovative, functional, and aesthetically pleasing. Even though it might have familiar features,<br> 
        I want people to find my website unique. I want them to find it easy to use and for every aspect to work the way I planned it to. And the most important<br> 
        thing is, I want them to see it as beautiful and organised in a creative way.<br><br>

        <br>

        <u>Interface Elements</u>
        <ul>
        <li>Input controls: I will add a text field with a submit button for users to leave me a message or contact me. This will added at the bottom of my Profile page.</li>
        <br>

        <li>Informational Components: I will add tooltips for the images that I use to describe the contents of the image. I might also add a progress bar for people who 
        <br>view my website to see when they have viewed all the pages of my website.</li>
        <br>

        <li>Navigational Components: I will add navigation tabs on the top of each page. I will also add pagination on each page and at the bottom of my Profile and 
        <br>Portfolio page, I will add icons for my social media pages.</li>

        <h3>Reflection on how my original wireframes hold up in line with this process.</h3>
        <font size="4">
        <p>
        Now that I have learnt about the IxD Process, I have to redo my wireframes. This is because my original wireframes were very basic and I could have included more<br> 
        labels and descriptions. I did not make them too detailed because I did not have that many ideas and I was new to everything we were doing. So with more<br> 
        experience, ideas, as well as IxD theory, I'll have to rearrange the way I structure my wireframes and prioritise the most important things.

        <h3>Reflection on my work for Website 1.</h3>

        <ol type="1">
        <li><h3>Where have I struggled?</h3></li>
        <font size="4">
        <p>
        I did not struggle with anything when making Website 1. As mentioned before in my Week 1 blog, I did HTML in CAT class in high school so I am used to the coding<br>
        and how the tags are used. I just had to apply the theory from the lectures to my website such as semantic markup. Although, I had a bit of trouble trying to refrain<br>
        from styling my website because that is not required at the moment. I just want to add colour and nice fonts but I know that there is a process to everything and I<br> 
        need to perfect the basics before I go into the visual aspect.

        <li><h3>What am I proud of?</h3></li>
        <font size="4">
        <p>
        Firstly I am proud that I remembered HTML even though I last practised it in 2021. It's not a difficult language but I'm still proud that I can at least code it because I<br> 
        found C# really difficult to understand. Secondly, I am proud that my website has met all the requirements from the assignment rubric, all I need to do is edit my<br> 
        blogs, and add more things to my design page now that IxD has been introduced. Lastly, I am proud that I have been able to get my weekly work done on time.<br> 
        I was able to make time to write my blogs, work on my website, and do the lectures all while having other assignments for my other courses.Â         
        </p>
        </font>        

        <li><h3>What do I want to change going forward?</h3></li>     
        <font size="4">
        <p>
        Going forward, I want to work more on my IxD and Design Pages. This is because these are really important for showing viewers how I came up with my ideas for<br> 
        my website. I also want to do more research and reflections when I write my blogs. This is because it will show that I did not just rely on the lectures and assigned<br> 
        readings but I went above and beyond to make sure that my design decisions are well informed.
